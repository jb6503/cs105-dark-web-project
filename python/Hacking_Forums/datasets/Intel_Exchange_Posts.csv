To set up a verification bot, you need to do the following:Either run ""python credentialshelper.py"" to easily create them, or create the credentials file manually.Create a file named ""credentials.py"" (without quotes) in the same directory as the other scripts.In the file, you will need to create 4 key-value pairs:The keys are BOTUSERNAME, BOTPASSWORD, MODUSERNAME and MODPASSWORDThe format is 'key=""value""'.Example:----- BEGIN EXAMPLE -----BOTUSERNAME=""bla""BOTPASSWORD=""blub""MODUSERNAME=""plip""MODPASSWORD=""plop""----- END EXAMPLE -------------- BUGS ---------Feel free to report bugs to the3coder, who created this software.--------- COMPLAINS ----------Go to /dev/null",2 years and 4 weeks ago,the3coder8,What version of python should we use or is any version fine.,2 years and 4 weeks ago,knex9,"Very cool, keep it up!Will test it out, and see what it does.;-)",2 years and 3 weeks ago,Korruptor10,"Python nonstandard libraries required: PySocks, BeautifulSoup4, easyircThe problem is that this fucking easyirc library is written in 2.x and has not been converted, so atm you need python 2.A new version is now available here.As usual, extract the file (""tar xf IEDownloader.tar"") andRun ""python IEParser.py"" to update the posts and ""python IEServer.py"" to have a server running on localhost:5000 on which you can view the different thread by visiting the url ""http://127.0.0.1:5000/thread/<thread id>"", while <thread id> is the id of the thread you want to see.

They normally have a add running, you get 9.99credits if you register and purchase a certain amount of credits.     I recently started using a VPN and what i've noticed is that in certain countries you can also get an add that can give you 10 free private sneak peaks.So basically you click on that add, add a username, password and email and instantly gain 10 free sneak peaks ( normal sneak peaks cost 1 credit, 27 credits is like 30 euros if I remember correctly ).    What you can do with this is you can register, use that free bonus, *log out* ( its not really that easy as you will see ) and then register again and gain another 10 speak peak bonus.  As I said, it is not that easy, if it is your first time ever accessing the website and you are in a specific country ( like US ) you will get that add from them and you will be able to register and get the bonus. The problem comes when you try to do it again.   1.If you logout after registering and refresh the page to get the add in order to register again and gain the bonus it will not appear.    2.You can clear your browsing data ( cache and all that stuff ) enter the website again and you will probably get the bonus add but if you try to register it will either ask you to validate your email ( the problem with this is that you cannot repeat this unless you have a lot of emails ) or sometimes it will register but you will not receive the bonus.  3.I haven't tried this yet but you can also clear your browsing data and connect in with a different ip within US, this might work  and you will be able to login and receive the 10 sneak peak bonuses without the need of validating your email.Things to note: you cannot use the same email address, if you do you will be able to register but you will not get the bonuses.What I wanna know is, how does a website know you've been there before ? What does it keep track of to know its you and no someone else ? How can I get around it and get the perfect situation, registering without the need of validating via email address ?

RSA - asymmetric encryption - Point: Solves the problem of transferring encrpytion keys. How: Public and private key - one key encrpyts, one key decrypts. How is it broken: attacks in the implimentation, e.g. heartblead, where web ssl servers can be asked to hand over the keys they are using (or in fact anything in the server memory). attacks on the key: There is a mathematical relationship between the public key and private key. Since you give out the public key, someone ""could"" calculate your private key. However, since the precise mathematical relationship is not known how to calculate independantly from the size of the key, bigger and bigger keys take longer and longer to calculate. How long? Well, a 256 bit key takes a fraction of a second,a 512bit key takes about ten minutes on hardware your average consumer has. both take a fraction of a second on dedicated distributed hardware. anything less than an 8000bit key should be considered wholey insecure. Attacks on the math: implementations of big number calculators influenced to be much slower than they need to be, so calculations seem to take longer than they should. Attacks on the random number generators - so they only generate a few keys: http://www.loyalty.org/~schoen/rsa/ Symmetric encryption: Asymmtric encryption is also slow to encrypt/decrypt, so the solution is to use it to encrpyt the actual key used to encrypt a messsage, using a function that is ""fast"" to go from unecrypted message to encrypted message and vice versa. How is it Broken: getting the key (see above!!) statistical attacks (calculating the probability of certain keys or ranges of keys, I suppose attacking the random number generator to limit the number of keys produced also fits into this category) Poor implimentations e.g. http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/547708/torrentlocker-ransomware-cracked-and-decrypter-has-been-made/ What's best - chaining more than one. My preference to date is first using the rabbit cypher, then AES on top of that. Signatures: These stem from the days when public keys were used to verify the integrity of the message. imho this is a stupid idea. much better to imply verify integrity by having the integrity checks encrypted inside the message. The desire here is to verify the source of the message. KEEP ALL KEYS ""SAFE"" !!! I was planning on building an integrated proxy to allow such messages via forums.. Much better now seems to be a way to create a way to make encrypted attachments for forums/email/any digital delivery mechanism. This will take two forms: public messages: Anyone can read/open the attachment, as long as they have been given the authors public key private messages: only the intended recipients can read the message. The way to acheive this, seems to be to have the output format a lossless png image, with the content being the encrypted message.RE:attacks on the keyPrime factorisation is ""mostly"" a solved problem.See:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieveTheres off the shelf code for doing 512 and 1024 bit on generally available hardware knocking around on the web. More than that and you need to go either to distributed implementations which I haven't seen in the public web, or custom hardware (such as high bit computers rather than the 64bit stuff you can get off the shelf.)The alternative to RSA is Diffie Hellman Key Exchange, this appears to be a stronger mechanism, if you assume the supposed NSA leaks saying they broke it are actually disinformation intended to put people onto RSA - with the side note that it does appear that the standard keys in ECDH are backdoored.As for ""break all encryption"".No it doesn't. low visibility keys and chained algorithms (such as the AES+Rabbit suggested above) would not be broken by an ability to factor large primes.The method chosen for the LTBTBM framework is long term private keys stored on each node (built but not verified to FIPS-140-2 level 4).a large random number shared between nodes each session which is used in combination with the long term private key to establish session keys (both username and random number are shared with RSA, but breaking this reveals nothing more than the username, which in most cases is equivelent to the IP/onion address, so doesn't reveal anything about the comms)commands and content are delivered using different keys.___If you are just starting, on what is a highly technical, and very very math heavy topic.

Does anyone have downloads/access to DOD apps? I'd gladly pay for them,  or trade.

So, I don't think that's how it works.  The license plate number is no way associated with the manufacture of a car, so that would mean that this device could connect with whatever DMV and the records that associate the license plate with the VIN Number.  The problem I have with this is the DoD doesn't have access to DMVs.  Now, it is possible to gain access to other nations DMVs, and then go from there, but this means every manufacturer's ECM is the same, or there is a massive database on the phone? These ECM's are not complex, but to my understanding they have proprietary code (like real basic stuff), but it is not encoded the same.  Each digit/character/byte/whatever means completely different things even among the same manufacturer depending on year. Next is the security of these vehicles.  Just because there is a receiver that accepts some radio frequency code to unlock the door doesn't mean that it is capable of taking that code and then listen to coded instructions to do other stuff. 1994 is not known as the pinnacle of automotive technology.  You literally have to turn the key to connect the starter circuit.  If you watch those videos on how the real hackers take control of the vehicle, they wire in a device like a Raspberry PI or something to the vehicle, that can communicate.  Sure, it can take all of 5 minutes to hook it up, but you still need something that can listen to the commands you give and then tell the car to follow them; furthermore, the vehicle must also be physically capable of following the commands, like starting it, and unlocking the steering column.Cars in the last 5-10 years, depending on model, I am thoroughly convinced that they can easily be taken over.

As TCP checks if data transmission was ok, it will retransmit all that packet once again, which in some cases might be futile extra overhead, such as an video streaming, which the player computes and fix small missing data errors.Also in some cases the error correction on the VPN layer may conflict with the correction made on the inner protocol, causing data do be reassembled out of order, which means more retransmission or data corruption, more ACKs to wait, and on extreme cases i believe it could cause even a deadlock.So tunneling TCP within UDP is better than UDP within TCP.Now regarding the main question of this thread, one can use OpenVPN with both protocols TCP or UDP, but for the same reasons as i said, its developers warns you to give preference to UDP.",29 weeks and 21 hours ago,ada377,"Hopefully, this is the right place for this.

Maybe while their computer is frozen and their files are being extracted, you could force their computer to play/loop a VERY loud porn clip.

Of course, knowing all the functions of PHP for example, helps you to determine which functions someone might be using on their website, which in turn helps pinpoint what security holes may exist.In my experience, the easiest way to learn how to program, is to edit something somewhat simple that already works, and then seeing what the results are.

Remember hacking is just exploitation of a hiccup in a system.  Humans don't create amazing code for two reasons 1) We are fallible, and 2) to create something so secure that other humans would find it worthless to find exploitations would take decades.  We live in a era where time is money, so they have to crank out versions, iterative development.  They publish the alpha versions to a select few to do quality assurance to a ""good enough"" point, then publish for sale.  It relies on bug reports and volunteering information to fix it. If you get ahead of others, then you can exploit.  Another thing to consider, is getting into the ""mindset"" of the computers.  They haven't really changed.  The only thing that changes is we keep abstracting languages to higher and higher levels.  The compilers take it all the way back down to machine code.  If you can start diving into assembly language.  It is the nuts and bolts.  Couple that with a debugger to see how the instructions are carried out.  If you find that at a certain point the program calls information from a file that you can use to gain access else where, you create a file and execute it in that program.  You now have a virus(?).

These methods can easiy be created and done with a script language of the on the victims OS (For example apple's OSX is very vunerable of phishing as they have applescript, and windows by having batch and serveral more...) or with an actual application made with eg. java..2) using an exploit. This is really advanced though! Youl need an exploit of the victims platform suitable for the attack. I will not supply you with one and i dont think anyone else will.3)Brute-force attack.

The shell now checks if it can CHMOD a directory(by comparing the values of the directory and the current process's owners) instead of just skipping one that doens't meat the requirements when looking for ""DAws's directory"".2. DAws now ""copies"" itself to ""DAws's Directory"" then drops the .htaccess and php.ini files, which are suppose to make life easier if suphp is installed, if that directory is within the web directory. It'll redirect the current user to that new copy of DAws. Because of all this DAws is much faster now since it is in its own directory, the right table doens't have to be full of crap that we don't care about and bypassing security systems if suphp is installed is now guaranteed.3. Fixed some ""serious"" permission bugs in the File Manager which were causing ""Rename"" and ""Del"" to appear/disappear when they shouldn't be.4. You can finally CHMOD a file/directory using the file manager. I am not sure why it took me so long to add this but who cares? It's here now, enjoy.5. Added File Owner and User's Group to the File Manager. Having this information is needed and should've been here since the beginning because the permissions makes no sense without it and I kept pushing this update because it's not ""that"" important since DAws checks everything for you but again, who cares? It's here now, enjoy lol.6. You can now ""Wipe"" a file instead of just Deleting it which makes it mostly impossible to get it recovered. DAws will simply replace the old file bytes with null ones, this isn't a very good ""wiper"" but it gets the job done pretty well.7. DAws now supports PDO for the Sql Connector. This is useful and needed in case ""mysqli_connect"" was blocked.8. You can now specify the ""Host"" when using the MySql Connector since the Host isn't always local and since a remote MySql server connection can be blocked unless it's coming from a specific client, so having this is obviously a  good thing. 9. You can now save the output of any Sql Query which is pretty useful if your MySql User had no file privileges.10. You can now execute Python, Perl and Ruby code on Windows.11. You can now chose the type of a Bind/Reverse shell instead of it being done automatically for you because why not? In some specific cases a coding language may fail because of some process restriction, for example, and DAws can't know that so this small change should solve that.12. You can now chose whether you want a reverse/bind shell or some eval code to run in the background or not(threw nohup for linux or start for windows) instead of it being chosen automatically for you.13. A dynamic fake 404 page has been finally added. (The code of the static one has been commented and is still at the top)14. DAws now checks if the current server is vulnerable to Shellshock threw ""normal"" command execution, I know that this isn't beneficial for DAws but it's good and useful information and you can now see it on the left table. (Keep in mind that DAws already uses Shellshock threw 2 methods to bypass security systems but this is completely something else).15. Removed a lot of extra lines that were holding nothing but a ""{"" for the sake of scrolling when reading the code...16. Fixed a lot of small bugs that were causing stuff like: showing the wrong location of the dropped cgi shell, wrong data in the .htaccess file for suphp on windows, getting redirected to the main shell's directory when using something other than the file manager, etc...Github: https://github.com/dotcppfile/DAws",50 weeks and 15 hours ago,dotcppfile530,Thanks for sharing!

Its facebook hacking (like the title says) and I will be shamelessly copying from a site. Ill be decent enough to give them credit (its a clearweb site) http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com Here goes the pasting process :p. Despite the security concerns that have plagued Facebook for years, most people are sticking around and new members keep on joining. This has led Facebook to break records numbers with over one billion monthly active users as of October 2012‰ÛÓand around 600 million active daily users.We share our lives on Facebook. We share our birthdays and our anniversaries. We share our vacation plans and locations. We share the births of our sons and the deaths of our fathers. We share our most cherished moments and our most painful thoughts. We divulge every aspect of our lives. We even clamor to see the latest versions even before they're ready for primetime.But we sometimes forget who's watching.We use Facebook as a tool to connect, but there are those people who use that connectivity for malicious purposes. We reveal what others can use against us. They know when we're not home and for how long we're gone. They know the answers to our security questions. People can practically steal our identities‰ÛÓand that's just with the visible information we purposely give away through our public Facebook profile.The scariest part is that as we get more comfortable with advances in technology, we actually become more susceptible to hacking. As if we haven't already done enough to aid hackers in their quest for our data by sharing publicly, those in the know can get into our emails and Facebook accounts to steal every other part of our lives that we intended to keep away from prying eyes.In fact, you don't even have to be a professional hacker to get into someone's Facebook account.It can be as easy as running Firesheep on your computer for a few minutes. In fact, Facebook actually allows people to get into someone else's Facebook account without knowing their password. All you have to do is choose three friends to send a code to. You type in the three codes, and voilÌÙ‰ÛÓyou're into the account. It's as easy as that.In this article I'll show you these, and a couple other ways that hackers (and even regular folks) can hack into someone's Facebook account. But don't worry, I'll also show you how to prevent it from happening to you.Method 1: Reset the PasswordThe easiest way to ""hack"" into someone's Facebook is through resetting the password. This could be easier done by people who are friends with the person they're trying to hack.The first step would be to get your friend's Facebook email login. If you don't already know it, try looking on their Facebook page in the Contact Info section.Next, click on Forgotten your password? and type in the victim's email. Their account should come up. Click This is my account.It will ask if you would like to reset the password via the victim's emails. This doesn't help, so press No longer have access to these?It will now ask How can we reach you? Type in an email that you have that also isn't linked to any other Facebook account.It will now ask you a question. If you're close friends with the victim, that's great. If you don't know too much about them, make an educated guess. If you figure it out, you can change the password. Now you have to wait 24 hours to login to their account.If you don't figure out the question, you can click on Recover your account with help from friends. This allows you to choose between three and five friends.It will send them passwords, which you may ask them for, and then type into the next page. You can either create three to five fake Facebook accounts and add your friend (especially if they just add anyone), or you can choose three to five close friends of yours that would be willing to give you the password.How to Protect YourselfUse an email address specifically for your Facebook and don't put that email address on your profile.When choosing a security question and answer, make it difficult. Make it so that no one can figure it out by simply going through your Facebook. No pet names, no anniversaries‰ÛÓnot even third grade teacher's names. It's as easy as looking through a yearbook.Learn about recovering your account from friends. You can select the three friends you want the password sent to. That way you can protect yourself from a friend and other mutual friends ganging up on you to get into your account.Method 2: Use a KeyloggerSoftware KeyloggerA software keylogger is a program that can record each stroke on the keyboard that the user makes, most often without their knowledge. The software has to be downloaded manually on the victim's computer. It will automatically start capturing keystrokes as soon as the computer is turned on and remain undetected in the background. The software can be programmed to send you a summary of all the keystrokes via email.CNET has Free Keylogger, which as the title suggests, is free. If this isn't what you're looking for, you can search for other free keyloggers or pay for one.Hardware KeyloggerThese work the same way as the software keylogger, except that a USB drive with the software needs to be connected to the victim's computer. The USB drive will save a summary of the keystrokes, so it's as simple as plugging it to your own computer and extracting the data. You can look through Keelog for prices, but it's bit higher than buying the software since you have the buy the USB drive with the program already on it.How to Protect YourselfUse a firewall. Keyloggers usually send information through the internet, so a firewall will monitor your computer's online activity and sniff out anything suspicious.Install a password manager. Keyloggers can't steal what you don't type. Password mangers automatically fill out important forms without you having to type anything in.Update your software. Once a company knows of any exploits in their software, they work on an update. Stay behind and you could be susceptible.Change passwords. If you still don't feel protected, you can change your password bi-weekly. It may seem drastic, but it renders any information a hacker stole useless.Method 3: PhishingThis option is much more difficult than the rest, but it is also the most common method to hack someone's account. The most popular type of phishing involves creating a fake login page. The page can be sent via email to your victim and will look exactly like the Facebook login page. If the victim logs in, the information will be sent to you instead of to Facebook. This process is difficult because you will need to create a web hosting account and a fake login page.The easiest way to do this would be to follow our guide on how to clone a website to make an exact copy of the facebook login page. Then you'll just need to tweak the submit form to copy / store / email the login details a victim enters. If you need help with the exact steps, there are detailed instructions available by Alex Long here on Null Byte. Users are very careful now with logging into Facebook through other links, though, and email phishing filters are getting better every day, so that only adds to this already difficult process. But, it's still possible, especially if you clone the entire Facebook website.How to Protect YourselfDon't click on links through email. If an email tells you to login to Facebook through a link, be wary. First check the URL (Here's a great guide on what to look out for). If you're still doubtful, go directly to the main website and login the way you usually do.Phishing isn't only done through email. It can be any link on any website / chat room / text message / etc. Even ads that pop up can be malicious. Don't click on any sketchy looking links that ask for your information.Use anti-virus & web security software, like Norton or McAfee.Method 4: Stealing CookiesCookies allow a website to store information on a user's hard drive and later retrieve it. These cookies contain important information used to track a session that a hacker can sniff out and steal if they are on the same Wi-Fi network as the victim. They don't actually get the login passwords, but they can still access the victim's account by cloning the cookies, tricking Facebook into thinking the hacker's browser is already authenticated.Image via wikimedia.orgFiresheep is a Firefox add-on that sniffs web traffic on an open Wi-Fi connection. It collects the cookies and stores them in a tab on the side of the browser.From there, the hacker can click on the saved cookies and access the victim's account, as long as the victim is still logged in. Once the victim logs out, it is impossible for the hacker to access the account.How to Protect YourselfOn Facebook, go to your Account Settings and check under Security. Make sure Secure Browsing is enabled. Firesheep can't sniff out cookies over encrypted connections like HTTPS, so try to steer away from HTTP.Full time SSL. Use Firefox add-ons such as HTTPS-Everywhere or Force-TLS.Log off a website when you're done. Firesheep can't stay logged in to your account if you log off.Use only trustworthy Wi-Fi networks. A hacker can be sitting across from you at Starbucks and looking through your email without you knowing it.Use a VPN. These protect against any sidejacking from the same WiFi network, no matter what website you're on as all your network traffic will be encrypted all the way to your VPN provider.Protecting Yourself: Less Is MoreSocial networking websites are great ways to stay connected with old friends and meet new people. Creating an event, sending a birthday greeting and telling your parents you love them are all a couple of clicks away.Facebook isn't something you need to steer away from, but you do need to be aware of your surroundings and make smart decisions about what you put up on your profile. The less information you give out on Facebook for everyone to see, the more difficult you make it for hackers.If your Facebook account ever gets hacked, check out our guide on getting your hacked Facebook account back for information on restoring your account.",2 years and 11 weeks ago,MANG00L00ER656,Oh btw.

I am thinking of having a database of images for different scenarios that the robot will check against.. for exam a database of people holding knieves ect.Problem Two: I want it to recognize words and tone of voice.. I don't mean every word I just mean it will know it someone is saying ""I'm going to kill you"" in an angry voice.Problem Three: I want it to recognize certain sounds, namely glass breaking, a struggle or gunshots. My default answer is to create a database (array?) that it will check though before making its decision.I know this sounds complicated but its not really.. the robot will only have a few classes within the main one. E.G. a isItAThreat method that will be part of the Threat class, that will scan through the databases (arrays). The behavior will be dictated by numbers, for example if the attack is using bad words, talking aggressively and has a knife the number generated will be different to that of someone just talking aggressively.

However these computers did not have the memory used in most computers today. Some programming is still done in Binary. Such as certain electronic components. The other day I received a voice recognition module in the mail. I actually had to configure the module by sending it commands in binary. However most programmers will not need to do this. Most programmers will only program in high level languages such as C++ or Java. To address the question of what binary itself is, you have to understand that a processor is billions of transistors. Either these transistors are turned on (represented as a binary digit of 1). Or the transistor is off (represented as a binary digit 0). so we can compare binary to a light switch that only has and on and off state. When a binary 1 is sent, it is nothing more than a surge of power being sent to the transistors. a binary 0 is the time when no power is running through the transistor. In actuality however all programs end up in binary at some stage. I modern computers the operating system hides this conversion. Typically the programs we use today are stored on our computer in binary.",1 year and 19 weeks ago,z3R0c001819,Which still does not explain how any of it works.I'm beginning to think it might be magic. Maybe all science is really just a subset of magic.,1 year and 18 weeks ago,Etyrnal820,"The compiler converts the high level programming language (C++, C, Java) into a generic binary code. This is then sent to the operating system which converts that code to low level programming language (Assembly language which is specific to the motherboard). From here the assemble code is changed back into binary but this time the binary is specific to the processor. When all is said and done all programs are nothing more than instructions that get carried out by the processor and the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).If this is not what your looking for as an answer, I would like to know which specific part you are curious about. As far as the commands that don't exist yet, they do exist. modern CPU's have thousands of commands that they know. In a modern programming language these commands are combined. For example cout is a term used in C and C++. This command is a combination of several assembly commands such as a Find command to search for the monitor at Address blah and Wait for a response from the monitor drivers to say that the monitor is connected. Then a Status command is used to make sure the monitor is not busy. Then another Wait command is done to wait for a response from the monitor. If all is good than a Send command is used to send instructions to the monitor. These monitor instructions may have just as long as a process as i have just explained. All of that just to print a line of text or a graphic on the screen. Now you may wonder how that many instructions can be carried out so quickly. The answer is the amount of the hertz of the processor. 1GH is your processor spec means 1 billion instructions can be carried out per second. So as you see a new command added to a programming language is simply combining commands together into a simpler command for a programmer to use. Binary code existed with the invention of the first mechanic computers. Back then the commands were fed into the computers through punch cards. As far as digging deeper into this would require me to have a degree in computer engineering (which i do not). All I can tell you is that the binary code is nothing more than a series of 1's and 0's that the processor understands and executes. With each generation of processor that comes out, more and more commands can be used. If you are looking for more information, Please let me know what specific part your looking to know more of. I can't promise to know the answer, however I will explain to the best of my knowledge.

These cannot make a computer a computer. The computer, not having been programmed to, cannot understand how to understand zeroes and ones. That said, they do. The positives and negatives are somehow read and comprehended.It's like computers were human children, able to learn a language instinctively.",1 year and 18 weeks ago,Etyrnal823,"The ones and zeros are only our representation. What they translate to is power on and off on those transistors. When a 1 is sent that means that voltage is applied on that transistor for a given time. when a 0 is sent it means that no voltage is applied. Without using a graphic, there's no other way to describe it. Lets look at 12 volt digital logic. A 1 would mean that 12 volts is being sent through the wire to the transistor to turn the transistor on. When a 0 is sent there is 0 volts being sent. People and the instruction sets inside processors are what makes computers smarter each generation. People representing programmers that find innovative ways to creation functionality from the programming language of choice. The processors instruction sets gives programmers new tools to use. Its not so much magic as it is the advancement in hardware and software technologies. As well as the innovative ways that people find to use them. If you ever get into being a programmer, you will notice there is a lot of math used in programming. Its not all math in numbers. Sometimes its comparing bytes of data to see if they are alike or different. its assignment statements. Its true or false logic. Programming is a complex activity and learning how to harness it to make the computer do something new can be tricky. However it is very rewarding. Programming is actually used in a lot more than computers. Power plants, auto pilots, cars, trains, phones, and thousands of other devices have programming making them work. An operating system such as Windows, Mac, and Linux hide a lot of the complexities and does make it look like magic.

Stile has gained significant power in Phaze as the Blue adept, whose songs and poems hold incredible power. However, on Proton he faces deportation and enters the tournament in the hope of gaining citizenship. His adversary is revealed to be the amulet-making Red Adept, who exists in Proton as a serf in the Tourney. Stile defeats her in combat in Phaze and in the Tourney on Proton, leading to her expulsion from both worlds. Photon a technological decadent world where rich (Citizens) live above the rules, and the serfs work and play the Games, hoping one day to be Citizens themselves. People live in Dome while the world outside is barren and dead.Phaze is a magical world where Adepts rule by fear and magic, and tribes of enchanted creatures exist, such as unicorns, werewolves, vampires and more. They also exists the Oracle, a device with will answer only one question to anyone. Most magic is restricted to the Adepts (Magic Users) and each spell can only be used once.Though different, the worlds are mirror images, what happens will happen to the other, or an imbalance will occur.Common Terms and Races:Citizens: The only people allowed to wear clothes, and they are some of the riches people in the galaxy. They control the protonite, which allows space to travel in space and the main power source for robots.Serfs: They are not allowed to wear clothes. A Citizen can do just about anything to a serf he or she wishes. Serfs can serve a maximum of 20 in Photon. Within this time a Citizen must employ them, with a 10 day grace period between jobs or they are deported. If they wish to stay longer they can enter the Game.The Game: The most common past time on Photon, games are chosen from a grid based on Physical skills or Mental skills or Chance or Art vs. either Naked, Tool, Machine, or Animal assisted games. Each player picks a category from one of the sides. Once this is done, more sub-menus appear until a game is selected. Each age has a Ladder, which is also separated into sexes, i.e. a 32 year old male would be in Ladder 32M. There is also the Leftover Ladder, the under aged, over aged, aliens, and the handicap. The top 5 of each ladder may enter the Tournament and the winner of the Tournament will become a Citizen.

I have access to a network's WPA2 passkey and I have confirmed that it is the correct passkey and can log in to the network but I wasn't able to access the internet at all. I deduced that the network was probably using a MAC address filtration which I thought would be easy to bypass.. This is the source of my frustration.

I confirm that my MAC address is now being spoofed but as soon as I try to connect to the network I encounter a ""Verification error"" message which is odd considering the password is correct and will allow me to connect if I use my actual MAC address but as soon as I spoof the one that does have access I have no access at all. What am I missing? (Go easy on me.. Noob at your mercy) 00 Dr.Roberts ",1 year and 20 weeks ago,Dr.Roberts955,"Hi Dr.Roberts , maybe this is your problem?If you've spoofed someone else's MAC address and they're on the network with you chances are you've received the same IP address and are causing enough collisions that the all transferred frames are being dropped or are timing out.If 2 devices try to transmit at the same instant, the transmit collision is detected, and both devices wait a random (but short) period before trying to transmit againMost routers, bridges, switches, and other network devices all expect to send and receive packets in an order. When you jump in the middle and start trying to receive someone else's packets chaos ensues.UpdateFrom the sounds of it, trying to change your MAC address on the network to bypass filtering or create anonymity is definitely something the Administrator who is responsible for the network is on the look-out for. If an exploit happens on the network, the Administrator is responsible and will be involved in providing all of the necessary records for the connections being made to whoever is involved in the investigation. He will in fact have to spend some time gathering this information in the event of an issue, so since he's likely a busy person already he would have systems in place to reduce this risk. Some localities require that all traffic be documented.If you're using a random MAC address to try and change the identity of your machine then it's probably in the best interest of the IT guy that he does block anything that you could do on the network because from a digital paper-trail perspective it's nearly impossible for him to track you through his normal means via connection logs in the router. That being said he can use an app like Wireshark and capture the network frames you're transmitting over the network and make a match for user accounts and accesses so he can then determine that both MAC addresses are likely the same person if the same user account is used on the same website.Additionally a lot of the schools (Universities) that I've been at will have a network that uses something like WPA2-Enterprise for their WiFi access which in some cases will make it look like you've connected even though you haven't provided all of the proper credentials (it can sometimes look like an open network). School networks (I'm assuming college or high school) will provide you with a login where you can connect with your account to your appropriate shares and they can monitor your activities as required by law.source:https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/36285/cant-connect-to-network-after-spoofing-a-mac-address",1 year and 20 weeks ago,NJF956,Thanks for the prompt and detailed reply...

I have quite a few gaps in my knowledge as it's more of a hobby, which I would like to turn into a career at some point. I know how to work metasploit,veil-evasion,write in a few languages (c#,c\c++,asm,javascript,java typical undergrad cs classes). What I'm missing is a systematic approach to exploitation. Any new guy can take code from exploitdb and launch it but in a red-test or similar, most of those don't work as patching gets aggressive (or does it? I have very limited experience). Is there a more up-to-date site for exploits or is finding 0day stuff so easy (though not for me) that they can sit on these exploits and launch them when they need them? Every now and then I sit down and fuzz odd software for fun in hopes of finding a vulnerability somewhere but never do, especially as aslr and dep make it incredibly difficult (I know ROP addresses this but I haven't had enough experience yet with it.)

MAC Spoofing     (i) Uninstall WhatsApp from your phone or device.     (ii) Obtain your target's phone. You'll need it for two different steps throughout the process, but this shouldn't take too long     (iii) Find your target's phone's Media Access Control (MAC) address. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to your phone or other device that essentially serves as its online identity. Find and write down your target's MAC address. It takes the form of six pairs of letters or numbers, separated by colons (01:23:45:67:89:ab).     * On an Android, find this in Settings ‰ Õ About phone ‰ Õ Status ‰ Õ Wi-Fi MAC address.    * On an iPhone, go to Settings ‰ Õ General ‰ Õ About ‰ Õ Wi-Fi Address.    * On a Windows phone, look in Settings ‰ Õ About ‰ Õ More info ‰ Õ MAC address.    * On a BlackBerry, go to Options ‰ Õ Device ‰ Õ Device and Status info ‰ Õ WLAN MAC.     If you find the MAC address as unavailable, turn on the 'WiFi' connectivity and then you'll get it instantly.     (iv) Find your MAC address using the instructions above. Backup your original MAC address as you would need to change it back to that after the ""work"" is done     (v) Change (""spoof"") your phone's MAC address to that of your target. This will allow your phone to pass as your target's, letting you convince WhatsApp that you are your target when you log in.     * On an iPhone or other device, install a MAC spoofing app like MacDaddy X or WifiSpoof. Use that to change your MAC address.    * On Android, install BusyBox and the Terminal Emulator (apps available for free on Google Play). In the terminal, type ""ip link show"" to see a list of interfaces. Identify the one that has your MAC address -- for this example, we'll use the eth0 interface. In the terminal emulator, enter ""ip link set eth0 address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"" and ""ip link set eth0 broadcast XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"", where eth0 is the interface you identified and XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is your target's MAC address. To check that you've successfully changed your MAC address, enter ""ip link show eth0.""     (vi) Install and configure WhatsApp on your phone. Enter your target's phone number to set up WhatsApp rather than your own. This will allow you to receive their messages and send messages from their account.     (vii) Get the confirmation code from your target's phone. This code will be sent to their phone number as part of the WhatsApp configuration process. Access their phone one last time to get that verification code. Enter it into WhatsApp on your phone when prompted, and you're all ready to go.     * If you don't want your target to find out about your spoofing, make sure to delete the confirmation code from their phone before they can see it.     {Note: This step is restricted to areas where MAC spoofing is known by the authorities and this has been taken as a step for all types of installations and reinstallations of Whatsapp Application}     (viii) When you no longer need to access your target's WhatsApp account, change your MAC address back to what it was. Repeat the instructions to change it, but this time change it to your original address rather than your target's. This will restore your phone to how it was originally, which will ensure that there are no future problems with Internet usage or connectivity.     2. Whatsapp Backup Database Access     (i) Find the WhatsApp database backup file and copy it on your computer.     * For non-rooted Android devices:    Quote:    /sdcard/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db.crypt    /phone/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db.crypt     * For rooted Android devices:    Quote:    /data/data/com.whatsapp/databases/msgstore.db    /data/data/com.whatsapp/databases/wa.db     If you extract the WhatsApp databse from msgstore.db or wa.db files, the name and phone number of a WhatsApp contact will also be displayed in the extracted file.    ***Android users directly refer from step (i) to step (iv)***      * If you use WhatsApp on iPhone, the WhatsApp backup file is,    net.whatsapp.WhatsApp/Documents/ChatStorage.sqlite     If you don‰Ûªt see this file, you can create it manually. To create a backup of your WhatsApp data on your iPhone, first connect it to your computer and start iTunes, and create a full unencrypted backup of your iPhone data.     (ii) Download and install the iPhone Backup Extractor. (http://cur.lv/k550d) Run the program and select the iPhone backup file your just created. Click on ‰Û÷Expert Mode‰Ûª in bottom right corner.     (iii)Click Application, find and select net.WhatsApp.WhatsApp and then click on Extract Selected.     *In the extracted data, the file ChatStorage.sqlite contains all your WhatsApp data backup. After the .sqlite file is extracted, you will get the crypted files.     (iv) Now download WhatsApp Xtract package (http://cur.lv/k550e) on your computer and extract it.     (v) Now, download and install Python (http://cur.lv/k550f) programming language environment on your computer. Download the 32bit (x86) version (nevertheless of your computer being 32 or 64), and install it {64 bit has several errors that can interfere}     * Do not be afraid. You do not need to know programming to operate Python. You just need to use a few commands to extract the Whatsapp backup file.     (vi) Open the extracted folder of Whataspp Xtract Package. Find a file named ""install pyCrypto.bat. Right-click the file and ""run as administrator"".     * This file will execute the following Python command:    Quote:    pypm install pycrypto     This command will automatically install the pycrypto library on your computer - which will be used to decrypt Whatsapp backup data.     (vii) Now in the same folder, run either whatsapp_xtract_iphone.bat, whatsapp_xtract_android_crypted.bat or whatsapp_xtract_android.bat depending upon the backup file you used. To run any of these files, simply right click on it and click run as administrator, just like above.     Another alternative method here is to run whatsapp_xtract_console.bat and specify the WhatsApp backup file manually     Quote:    /* For Android DB: */    python whatsapp_xtract.py -i msgstore.db -w wa.db     /* if wa.db is unavailable */    python whatsapp_xtract.py -i msgstore.db     /*for crypted db*/    python whatsapp_xtract.py -i msgstore.db.crypt     /*For iPhone DB*/    python whatsapp_xtract.py -i ChatStorage.sqlite     After the execution of the command will be completed, all Whatsapp backup data that you hauled into your computer will be decrypted and will be displayed on your default browser.     3. Whatsapp API and Reverse Engineering     WhatsAPI [ http://cur.lv/k550g ] is available as an XMPP platform for hands-on access for Whatsapp. WhatsApp uses customized XMPP server with proprietary extensions, named internally as FunXMPP.     WhatsApp Authentication / Login Mechanism: Just like any other XMPP, WhatsApp uses jabber id and password to login. The password is hashed, stored in servers upon account creation and used transparently everytime the client connects the server.     On Android, the password is a md5 hash of the reversed IMEI number:    Quote:    $imei = ""112222223333334""; // example IMEI    $androidWhatsAppPassword = md5(strrev($imei)); // reverse IMEI and calculate md5 hash     On iOS, the password is generated from the devices WLAN MAC address:    Quote:    $wlanMAC = ""AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF""; // example WLAN MAC address    $iphoneWhatsAppPassword = md5($wlanMAC.$wlanMAC); // calculate md5 hash using the MAC address twice     Both IMEI and MAC address are easily retrievable from devices if you have physical access to it. MAC address is much easier to capture as you can sniff on the wireless network to which iOS device is connected.     The Jabber ID is a concatenation between your country‰Ûªs code and mobile number.     Initial login uses Digest Access Authentication. You can try this for yourself:     Quote:    http://cur.lv/k550h     Quote:    $countrycode = the country calling code    $phonenumber = the users phone number (without the country calling code)    $password = see above, for iPhone use md5($wlanMAC.$wlanMAC), for Android use e md5(strrev($imei))     The response you would receive would be in XML, containing messages designated for your phone.      Text Messages: Messages are basically sent as TCP packets, following WhatsApp‰Ûªs own format (unlike what‰Ûªs defined in XMPP RFCs).     Photos, Videos and Audio files shared with WhatsApp contacts are HTTP-uploaded to a server before being sent to the recipient(s) along with Base64 thumbnail of media file (if applicable) along with the generated HTTP link as the message body.     Another vital piece of information:    Quote:    ~blank line~    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://cur.lv/k550i"">    <plist version=""1.0"">    <array>    <dict>    <key>P</key>    <string>1234567890</string>    <key>T</key>    <integer>10817</integer>    <key>S</key>    <string>Your Status Here</string>    <key>JID</key>    <string>23xxxxxxxxx</string>    <key>NP</key>    <true/>    </dict>    </array>    </plist>    ~blank line~     Here, the key P refers to the user's phone number    T seems to be uptime    S is the status message    JID is the Jabber ID    NP has not been confirmed yet.     This is an official privacy leak from Whatsapp.     Reverse Engineering with IMEI and MAC addresses can create a JID for login onto WhatsAPI to access Whatsapp Chats.     4. Spyware     This is no-doubt, the easiest method to sniff the chat logs of a person. Android RATs can also substitute the use of Spyware in this case     (i) Choose an app or program to use.    * There are several premium paid programs like mSpy, Spymaster Pro, Copy9 and Mobile Spy which can assure premium spy service     * There are also free applications for spying on other's phones. Children Tracker, Spy Video Recorder, and Secret Agent which can allow remote access to the victim's phone.     (ii) Buy/install your chosen application. Once you've made your purchase, follow the instructions to install the app. This will usually involve installing it on your phone or computer as well as on the phone that you'll be monitoring.     (iii) Set up the app and start tracking. Follow the app's instructions to make sure everything is set up properly so that you can view all the desired information. You should start receiving their WhatsApp messages, as well as any other information you've included.     5. Dead Method     This method was a popular way to sniff the Whatsapp Password without physical access to the client's phone.     As of August 2013, this method has died off, because Whatsapp traffic has stopped being shown on mitmproxy and SSLsplit - making this method a dead one. The new August 2013 update of the Whatsapp client requires the client software to check the certificate fingerprints, which makes password sniffing/forgery via proxies almost impossible.     Similarly, WhatsAPI was down on February 2014 due to DMCA infrigement but has been brought back online a few months ago.   6.Whatsapp sniffer (i am not sure if it still works)   basically this method is when your connected with the suspect on the same wifi it works by sniffing his data.

Many people who call themselves ""hackers"" talk about reverse engineering, by getting the source code of a program they can analyze it and understand how the system works so they can mimic it or improve it. Forgive my inexperience/ignorance, but how do I reach the source code of software that isn't open source?",1 year and 37 weeks ago,vidalspano1066,"You don't. Your definition of the concept of reverse engineering is slightly off. What ""hackers"" do when actually reverse engineering, is closely monitoring the behaviour of a system in order to discover the whole of its potentially many inputs and outputs and the way these are interrelated. By doing this, it's possible to determine the complete behaviour of a system without having access to its design or code, enabling you to create your own compatible implementation.It is generally possible to decompile closed source software, but the result of that is usually very difficult to read. During compilation of the original sources, the compiler and linker strip out almost all information that's useful to humans. Another ""destructive"" property of compilers is the fact that they optimize. A simple example of this would be the unrolling of loops. A programmer would write ""do this action ten times"", which an optimizing compiler in some cases could implement as ""do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action"" because in some cases the CPU can deliver the end result faster this way at the cost of a little bit of redundancy.A high-profile case of reverse engineering is the Samba project. It allows UNIX-like operating systems to share files using MS Windows' native protocols. Originally MS didn't provide any specifications at all for these protocols so the developers had to closely observe what Windows systems were doing amongst themselves on a network in order to reimplement identical behaviour. This provided a working implementation in the end, but it's very difficult to find all edge cases this way.",1 year and 37 weeks ago,Borax1067,I see.

Using a stolen key to sign a kernel driver isn't exactly genious-level programming.,1 year and 38 weeks ago,Borax1119,"the start point for the infection certainly was not clever .. ie the dumb human (or bribed insider) inserting a flash drive, but as Stuxnet goes to work, bypassing both the operating system‰Ûªs  inherent security measures and any anti-virus software that may be present.  Upon interrogation by the OS, it presents itself as a legitimate auto-run file.  Legitimacy, is conferred by means of a digital certificate.  A digital certificate (or identity certificate) is an electronic cryptographic document used to prove identity or legitimacy.  The certificate includes information about a public cryptographic key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct.  If the signature is valid, and the person or system examining the certificate trusts the signer, then it is assumed that the public cryptographic key or software signed with that key is safe for use.Stuxnet proffers a stolen digital certificate to prove its trustworthiness.  Now vetted, the worm begins its own interrogation of the host system. :  Stuxnet confirms that the OS is a compatible version of Microsoft Windows and, if an anti-virus program is present, whether it is one that Stuxnet‰Ûªs designers had previously compromised.  Upon receiving positive confirmation, Stuxnet downloads itself into the target computer.It drops two files into the computer‰Ûªs memory.  One of the files requests a download of the main Stuxnet archive file, while the other sets about camouflaging Stuxnet‰Ûªs presence using a number of techniques, including modifying file creation and modification times to blend in with the surrounding system files and altering the Windows registry to ensure that the required Stuxnet files run on startup.  Once the archived file is downloaded, the Stuxnet worm unwraps itself to its full, executable form.Meanwhile, the original Stuxnet infection is still on the USB flash drive.  After successfully infecting three separate computers, it commits ‰ÛÏsecurity suicide.‰Û  That is, like a secret agent taking cyanide to ensure that she can‰Ûªt be tortured to reveal her secrets, Stuxnet deletes itself from the flash drive to frustrate the efforts of malware analysts.Internally to the target computer, Stuxnet has been busy.  It uses its rootkit to modify, and become part of the OS.  Stuxnet is now indistinguishable from Windows; it‰Ûªs become part of the computer‰Ûªs DNA.  It‰Ûªs now that Stuxnet becomes a detective, exploring the computer and looking for certain files.  Specifically, Stuxnet is looking for industrial control system (ICS) software created by Siemens called Simatic PCS7 or Step 7 running on a Siemens Simatic Field PG notebook (a Windows-based system dedicated for ICS use).  The problem facing Stuxnet at this point is that a computer can contain millions, if not tens of millions, of files and finding the right Step 7 file is a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack.  In order to systematize the search, Stuxnet needs to find a way to travel around the file system as it conducts its stealthy reconnaissance.  It does this by attaching itself to a very specific kind of process.:  One that is trusted at the highest levels by the OS and that looks at every single file on the computer.  Something like. . . . . .the scan process used by anti-virus software.  (In the attack on the facility in Natanz, Stuxnet compromised and used the scan processes from leading anti-virus programs.  (It‰Ûªs worth noting that all of the companies whose products were compromised have long since remedied the vulnerabilities that Stuxnet exploited.)  Along the way, Stuxnet compromises every comparable process it comes across, pervading the computer‰Ûªs memory and exploiting every resource available to execute the search.  All the while, Stuxnet is constantly executing housekeeping functions.  When two Stuxnet worms meet, they compare version numbers, and the earlier version deletes itself from the system.   Stuxnet also continuously evaluates its system permission and access level.  If it finds that it does not have sufficient privileges, it uses a previously unknown system vulnerability (such a thing is called a ‰ÛÏZero-Day,‰Û and will be discussed below) to grant itself the highest administrative privileges and rights.    If a local area network (LAN) connection is available, Stuxnet will communicate with Stuxnet worms on other computers and exchange updates ‰ÛÒ ensuring that the entire Stuxnet cohort running within the LAN is the most virulent and capable version.   If an Internet connection is found, Stuxnet reaches back to its command and control (C2) servers and uploads information about the infected computers, including their internet protocol (IP) addresses, OS types and whether or not Step 7 software has been found.As noted earlier, Stuxnet relied on four Zero-Day vulnerabilities to conduct its attacks.  Zero-Days are of particular interest to hacker communities.:  Since they‰Ûªre unknown, they are by definition almost impossible to defend against.  Stuxnet‰Ûªs four Zero-Days included:    The Microsoft Windows shortcut automatic file execution vulnerability which allowed the worm to spread through removable flash drives;    A print spooler remote code execution vulnerability; and    TWO different privilege escalation vulnerabilities.Once Stuxnet finds Step 7 software, it patiently waits and listens until a connection to a PLC is made.  When Stuxnet detects the connection, it penetrates the PLC and begins to wreak all sorts of havoc.  The code controlling frequency converters is modified and Stuxnet takes control of the converter drives.  What‰Ûªs of great interest is Stuxnet‰Ûªs method of camouflaging its control.  Reporting signals indicating abnormal behavior sent by the PLC are intercepted by Stuxnet and in turn signals indicating nominal, normal behavior are sent to the monitoring software on the control computer.Stuxnet is now in the position to effect a physical attack against the gas centrifuges.

If you are considering newer hardware, look for phones with wifi chipsets that can enable rfmon mode (not only at the driver level but also at the firmware). I believe the GS1/2 has rfmon support through modified drivers and custom wifi chipset firmware, try to avoid Broadcom chipsets even though theyre almost ubiquitous these days. You can also go another route and plug external usb wifi adapters in via a USB OTG cable (and seperate powersupply just for wifi adaptor) but that requires you to build a custom ROM (with your wifi adapters drivers build against the ROMs specific kernel IIRC) and use a chroot jail to host the tools and is a pretty untidy solution.

What's with all the weird headers you're including for no apparent reason? You're also setting yourself up to go 100% Windows-only with your code (the Sleep function is Windows-only). Is that on purpose? You're now also mixing up the use of namespaces. Either you put in a 'using' statement and forget about std:: altogether, or you don't and type std:: in front of every function you invoke from this namespace. The way you're doing it now is a major mess.What exactly do you mean when you say 'string arrays'? Just a group of strings? Have a look at std::vector and std::string for that.#include <iostream>#include <string>#include <vector>int main() {  std::string firstSentence = ""This is my first string."";  std::string secondSentence = ""This is my second string."";  std::vector <std::string> stringArray; //Define a vector called stringArray that will hold std::string objects  stringArray.push_back(firstSentence); //stringArray's push_back method places a std::string into the vector.  stringArray.push_back(secondSentenc);  std::cout << stringArray[0] << std::endl; //Outputs firstSentence, index location 0  std::cout << stringArray[1] << std::endl; //Outputs secondSentenc, index location 1  return ( 0 );}I deliberately did this example in a way that introduces *ONLY* the concepts of std::string and a std::vector to contain them. The way it reads and writes to the vector is *NOT* by the book but I didn't want to introduce too many new constructs in one example. Also, you don't really need to create the firstSentence and secondSentence std::string variables. You could just add a line of text to this vector by doing:stringArray.push_back(""God shave the Queen.. please!"");..but then you'd miss that the std::string object gracefully accepts a const char* and converts it to a std::string for you on the fly. Very useful to have happening, but it's essential that you're conscious of the fact that C++ performs a bit of ""magic"" behind the scenes for you here. You should never rely on this behaviour because a const char* is completely different from a std::string in a technical sense.What resource are you using to guide you as you're learning? Seems to me it's all over the place, mostly learning C-isms that work against the way C++ was designed. There are very books around, which can be had for free online.

Don't just trust me on this, maybe someone else could weigh in.Rounding errors come from using int, a fairly imprecise type if you're doing more than just addition, substration and multiplication. Try doing this:#include <iostream>int main() {  int numberOne = 5;  int numberTwo = 9;  std::cout << numberTwo / numberOne << std::endl;  std::cin.ignore();  return (0);}That'd return 1 as the outcome of 9/5 because int doesn't have high enough precision and just chops off the decimal from 1.8, leaving you an incorrect 1. Replace the ints with doubles and see what it does. When using double instead of int you'll have the opportunity to round your numbers in a mathematically correct way before possible converting them back to int.I'll get back to you on the books.

If it's WEP, then its generally fairly easy to crack using Aircrack-ng. However, WPA/WPA2 two will need to be forced with the following methods, these are just a few to keep in mind:-The evil twin method: Launch a DOS (via De-auth requests) against one of the registered computers on the targeted wifi network, forcing the user to be disconnected. From there, set up your own little honeypot with the same ESSID & BSSID as the other wifi network and try to effectively trick the person to try logging in to your connection. At that point you'll see the password that was entered through the other computer's attempted access. From there you could alse allow the user on and let the honey-potting begin! :) -Bruteforce via Aircrack-ng by capturing a WPA/WPA2 handshake from the targeted wifi by de-authing a user on the network, and then waiting for the re-connection reply sent. From there take the capture file, and crack the password via wordlist or Charlist. (Takes the most time, however more likely to have success if you have enough patience to wait that long for results.)-WPS-PSK pin cracking - basically trying random combinations of pin numbers until the right one is found.

We can have a categorized master list of legitimate sites while also listing fraudulent ones beneath. Just tried signing up for the bogus Intel Exchange with a new username. User registration doesn't work, as well as login. It appears that they've scraped everything rather than getting the server-side code. People trying to use these bogus sites won't be able to login.

Let Me Count the WaysBy Bill Blunden, September 21, 2014In the past couple of days both Google and Apple have announced that they‰Ûªre enabling default encryption on their mobile devices so that only the user possessing a device's password can access its local files. The public relations team at Apple makes the following claim:""Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data... So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8""The marketing drones at Google issued a similar talking point:""For over three years Android has offered encryption, and keys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement... As part of our next Android release, encryption will be enabled by default out of the box, so you won't even have to think about turning it on.""Quite a sales pitch? Cleverly disguised as a news report no less. Though it‰Ûªs not stated outright the tacit message is: open your wallet for the latest gadget and you‰Ûªll be safe from Big Brother. Sadly, to a large degree this perception of warrant protection is the product of Security Theater aimed at rubes and shareholders. The anti-surveillance narrative being dispensed neglects the myriad of ways in which such device-level encryption can be overcome. A list of such techniques has been enumerated by John Young,the architect who maintains the Cryptome leak site. Young asks readers why he should trust hi-tech‰Ûªs sales pitch and subsequently presents a series of barbed responses. For example:Because they can't covertly send your device updated software [malware] that would change all these promises, for a targeted individual, or on a mass basis?Because this first release of their encryption software has no security bugs, so you will never need to upgrade it to retain your privacy?Because the US export control bureaucracy would never try to stop Apple from selling secure mass market proprietary encryption products across the border?Because the countries that wouldn't let Blackberry sell phones that communicate securely with your own corporate servers, will of course let Apple sell whatever high security non-tappable devices it wants to?Because they want to help the terrorists win?Because it's always better to wiretap people after you convince them that they are perfectly secure, so they'll spill all their best secrets?Another thing to keep in mind is that local device encryption is just that. Local. As Bruce Schneier points out this tactic does little to protect user data that‰Ûªs stored in the cloud. When push comes to shove executives will still be able to hand over anything that resides on corporate servers.Marketing spokesmen are eager to create the impression that companies are siding with users in thestruggle against mass surveillance (never mind the prolific corporate data mining). Especially after business leaders denied participating in the NSA‰Ûªs PRISM program. Yet the appearance of standing up to government surveillance is often a clever ployto sell you stuff, a branding mechanism. It‰Ûªs important to recognize that Internet companies, especially billion dollar hi-tech multinationals like Yahoo and Cisco, exist to generate revenue and have clearly demonstrated the tendency to choose profits over human rights when it‰Ûªs expedient.SourceApple and Spy DisbeliefDate: Sun, 21 Sep 2014 05:46:57 +0000From: Jacob Appelbaum <jacob[at]appelbaum.net>To: John Denker <jsd[at]av8n.com>Cc: cryptography[at]metzdowd.comSubject: Re: [Cryptography] new wiretap resistance in iOS 8?On 9/20/14, John Denker <jsd[at]av8n.com> wrote:> On 09/19/2014 09:16 PM, John Gilmore wrote:>> There must be some other reason, I'm just having trouble thinking of it.>> 1) As the proverb says, don't let the perfect be the>  enemy of the good.>>  There will never be perfect security.

It is well founded, I agree with it and I don't dismiss it either. Still - here we have evidence of PRISM and Apple's complicity or victimization. Just above you suggest that the enemy of the perfect is the enemy of good enough - it may not be perfect, HTC phones may also be weakened by someone - but if it isn't the NSA, I'd be happy with that as a good solution.

I've had a senior NSA person tell me that EO12333 allows NSA to collect on the Tor network in the US and outside without exception. This has cost them nothing. Alexander, Clapper and others are all free. They are not punished - they are part of a culture of impunity.The NSA and other ""Intelligence Community"" members have been doing this for longer than I've been alive. They've been getting caught for ages and no reform has changed anything except in public perception that it is happening at all.

They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services. The attack involved modifying Tor protocol headers to do traffic confirmation attacks.The attacking relays joined the network on January 30 2014, and we removed them from the network on July 4. While we don't know when they started doing the attack, users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected.Unfortunately, it's still unclear what ""affected"" includes. We know the attack looked for users who fetched hidden service descriptors, but the attackers likely were not able to see any application-level traffic (e.g. what pages were loaded or even whether users visited the hidden service they looked up). The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service. In theory the attack could also be used to link users to their destinations on normal Tor circuits too, but we found no evidence that the attackers operated any exit relays, making this attack less likely. And finally, we don't know how much data the attackers kept, and due to the way the attack was deployed (more details below), their protocol header modifications might have aided other attackers in deanonymizing users too.Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (0.2.4.23 or 0.2.5.6-alpha), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used ‰ÛÓ but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem. Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one. Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.THE TECHNICAL DETAILS:We believe they used a combination of two classes of attacks: a traffic confirmation attack and a Sybil attack.A traffic confirmation attack is possible when the attacker controls or observes the relays on both ends of a Tor circuit and then compares traffic timing, volume, or other characteristics to conclude that the two relays are indeed on the same circuit. If the first relay in the circuit (called the ""entry guard"") knows the IP address of the user, and the last relay in the circuit knows the resource or destination she is accessing, then together they can deanonymize her. You can read more about traffic confirmation attacks, including pointers to many research papers, at this blog post from 2009:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enoughThe particular confirmation attack they used was an active attack where the relay on one end injects a signal into the Tor protocol headers, and then the relay on the other end reads the signal. These attacking relays were stable enough to get the HSDir (""suitable for hidden service directory"") and Guard (""suitable for being an entry guard"") consensus flags. Then they injected the signal whenever they were used as a hidden service directory, and looked for an injected signal whenever they were used as an entry guard.The way they injected the signal was by sending sequences of ""relay"" vs ""relay early"" commands down the circuit, to encode the message they want to send. For background, Tor has two types of cells: link cells, which are intended for the adjacent relay in the circuit, and relay cells, which are passed to the other end of the circuit. In 2008 we added a new kind of relay cell, called a ""relay early"" cell, which is used to prevent people from building very long paths in the Tor network. (Very long paths can be used to induce congestion and aid in breaking anonymity). But the fix for infinite-length paths introduced a problem with accessing hidden services, and one of the side effects of our fix for bug 1038 was that while we limit the number of outbound (away from the client) ""relay early"" cells on a circuit, we don't limit the number of inbound (towards the client) relay early cells.So in summary, when Tor clients contacted an attacking relay in its role as a Hidden Service Directory to publish or retrieve a hidden service descriptor (steps 2 and 3 on the hidden service protocol diagrams), that relay would send the hidden service name (encoded as a pattern of relay and relay-early cells) back down the circuit. Other attacking relays, when they get chosen for the first hop of a circuit, would look for inbound relay-early cells (since nobody else sends them) and would thus learn which clients requested information about a hidden service.There are three important points about this attack:A) The attacker encoded the name of the hidden service in the injected signal (as opposed to, say, sending a random number and keeping a local list mapping random number to hidden service name). The encoded signal is encrypted as it is sent over the TLS channel between relays. However, this signal would be easy to read and interpret by anybody who runs a relay and receives the encoded traffic. And we might also worry about a global adversary (e.g. a large intelligence agency) that records Internet traffic at the entry guards and then tries to break Tor's link encryption. The way this attack was performed weakens Tor's anonymity against these other potential attackers too ‰ÛÓ either while it was happening or after the fact if they have traffic logs. So if the attack was a research project (i.e. not intentionally malicious), it was deployed in an irresponsible way because it puts users at risk indefinitely into the future.(This concern is in addition to the general issue that it's probably unwise from a legal perspective for researchers to attack real users by modifying their traffic on one end and wiretapping it on the other. Tools like Shadow are great for testing Tor research ideas out in the lab.)B) This protocol header signal injection attack is actually pretty neat from a research perspective, in that it's a bit different from previous tagging attacks which targeted the application-level payload. Previous tagging attacks modified the payload at the entry guard, and then looked for a modified payload at the exit relay (which can see the decrypted payload). Those attacks don't work in the other direction (from the exit relay back towards the client), because the payload is still encrypted at the entry guard. But because this new approach modifies (""tags"") the cell headers rather than the payload, every relay in the path can see the tag.C) We should remind readers that while this particular variant of the traffic confirmation attack allows high-confidence and efficient correlation, the general class of passive (statistical) traffic confirmation attacks remains unsolved and would likely have worked just fine here. So the good news is traffic confirmation attacks aren't new or surprising, but the bad news is that they still work. See https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough for more discussion.Then the second class of attack they used, in conjunction with their traffic confirmation attack, was a standard Sybil attack ‰ÛÓ they signed up around 115 fast non-exit relays, all running on 50.7.0.0/16 or 204.45.0.0/16. Together these relays summed to about 6.4% of the Guard capacity in the network. Then, in part because of our current guard rotation parameters, these relays became entry guards for a significant chunk of users over their five months of operation.We actually noticed these relays when they joined the network, since the DocTor scanner reported them. We considered the set of new relays at the time, and made a decision that it wasn't that large a fraction of the network. [VALIS: OMGWTFBBQ?!] It's clear there's room for improvement in terms of how to let the Tor network grow while also ensuring we maintain social connections with the operators of all large groups of relays. (In general having a widely diverse set of relay locations and relay operators, yet not allowing any bad relays in, seems like a hard problem; on the other hand our detection scripts did notice them in this case, so there's hope for a better solution here.)In response, we've taken the following short-term steps:1) Removed the attacking relays from the network.2) Put out a software update for relays to prevent ""relay early"" cells from being used this way.3) Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time.4) Clients can tell whether they've received a relay or relay-cell. For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase ""Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell"".The following longer-term research areas remain:5) Further growing the Tor network and diversity of relay operators, which will reduce the impact from an adversary of a given size.6) Exploring better mechanisms, e.g. social connections, to limit the impact from a malicious set of relays. We've also formed a group to pay more attention to suspicious relays in the network:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays7) Further reducing exposure to guards over time, perhaps by extending the guard rotation lifetime:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relayhttps://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard...8) Better understanding statistical traffic correlation attacks and whether padding or other approaches can mitigate them.9) Improving the hidden service design, including making it harder for relays serving as hidden service directory points to learn what hidden service address they're handling:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-loveOPEN QUESTIONS:Q1) Was this the Black Hat 2014 talk that got canceled recently?Q2) Did we find all the malicious relays?Q3) Did the malicious relays inject the signal at any points besides the HSDir position?Q4) What data did the attackers keep, and are they going to destroy it? How have they protected the data (if any) while storing it?Great questions. We spent several months trying to extract information from the researchers who were going to give the Black Hat talk, and eventually we did get some hints from them about how ""relay early"" cells could be used for traffic confirmation attacks, which is how we started looking for the attacks in the wild. They haven't answered our emails lately, so we don't know for sure, but it seems likely that the answer to Q1 is ""yes"".

This also makes it much more flexible (i.e. data types are allowed to change).As the speed difference is usually negligible (unless it's a massive part of a program, like a monolithic kernel), but the flexibility is noticeable (for the programmer, not the user), I tend to prefer languages that leave things to be done at run-time.",2 years and 9 weeks ago,Zyx1501,"TO O-Neil, TO whitetiger1000, TO Zyx.Thank you all so much for your contributions you have restored my faith in humanity,I love this site there's some really good folks here am delighted to be a member,and so glad am getting help to learn to write code,until o-neil told there's all different types of code i did'nt even know so there am starting to learn :)thank you buddy,and whitetiger1000 i would love those books and defo the video's would so helpful friend,oh btw i looked for bucky but could'nt find him have you a link please.and finally Zyx Thank you so much for your information although to be honest it sort of went over my head as am a complete noobie when it comes to PC codeing and program writing I know nothing but am honest about that,and i have time on my side lots of free time but what you said zyx my friend about learning your 1st language is so true its like learning russian or chinese dear lord computer terminolgy is like another language to learn i have much to learn.so any and all help is so much needed and i hope in time i can contribute back if i am successful in learning how to write code,wish me luck :).so whitetiger1000 them links if you can find them please and bucky who i cant find on utube also Thanks,and anyone else new to this topic i created who can help in anyway please submit thank you in advance,Take care all and have a peaceful week :).SIG--All that is necessary for the triumph of evil and wrong-doing is that good men and women sit back and do nothing.",2 years and 9 weeks ago,cod3001502,@cod300:  I Found him hahaha here you go:> https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewbostonStart off with the C programming tutorial and then C++ for extra and then JAVA to better understand it make sure you follow all videos in sequence.And again have no idea how to upload the books LOL its books and notes I studied from and got my Degree in.also have expirence in SQL/PL-SQLbut thats more related to databaseanyway goodluck ,2 years and 9 weeks ago,whitetiger10001503,"@whitetiger1000,Thank you friend i followed your link his name is Bucky Roberts, YES THANK GOODNESS :).am going to start accessing the intel iv'e been given Thus far and see were it leads thanks once againfor your help in getting me started and everyone else also i can see this will be time consuming but it will be worth itonce i aquire the knowledge,which i know will take time to learn.If you friend or anyone for that matter remember's anything else to help me along please drop me a few lines,I also feel other membershere om IE will benefit in this subject/topic,This is a great skill to have especially now that we all live more or less in a digitalAge.Take care all :).SIG--All that is necessary for the triumph of evil and wrong-doing is that good men and women sit back and do nothing.",2 years and 9 weeks ago,cod3001504,I have a locked Samsung Galaxy Ace IIx that I have locked myself out of.

I did some more research and found that a company called infiniteskills have made a video series teaching you c++. It wasnt free ofcourse but I 'aquired' it elsewhere.

Most companies (and I think all mobile phone companies) log text messages in their own system, which can be subject to subpoenas from law enforcement or the courts. They do this to cover their ass and will quickly rat you out if you are using their services for illegal purposes. It is usually only the direct service, though. The phone company is not logging information that you have sent to Facebook, for example, only Facebook keeps that information (forever and ever... even if you delete it, it is just setting the visibility to off somewhere in the database, but the original text is still there).The good news is that unless you are a target from the Feds, nobody is probably spying on you. They get way too many messages to ever waste time trying to find something illegal themselves, or even just a cheap thrill. They could honestly care less what you do on their systems as long as it does not come back to bite them in the ass. But, if you are a terrorist or pedophile, you would be a complete idiot to ever communicate through these types of systems unless it is PGP encrypted at each end (so messages are encrypted on their servers by you and they cannot decrypt them without the private key and passphrase).Last comment. Even if you visit a site in SSL (https://), spies/feds can still sniff the header information, IP and URL in plain text. So going to https://pedochat.com/underage is a dead giveaway even if the actual content of the webpage chat is encrypted. There is also a good possibility it is a trap or setup from law enforcement and all information is being logged on the server in plain text (SSL only encrypts data sent through the internet, not the data stored on the server).

No? How about Facebook?  MSN, or Hotmail? Yahoo? You might be surprised, comparing the  results.  Nice, innit? See the ""Last Updated"" part also.  The  brand-protecting, anti-piracy company MarkMonitor Inc. has had all  these DNS names under its control for several months now.  They  also control the Wikimedia name services, even though that doesn't  show up on the Wikimedia.org whois record. There are many others.  Apple.com falls under their jurisdiction, as does ubuntu.com.  Nokia.com? Yep, under MarkMonitor. See a pattern here?   MarkMonitor also is a trusted Certificate Authority; they have, in  essence, the means to fabricate safe-looking SSL connections for  you, to whichever host they want. Your browser will not sound any  warnings of possible man-in-the-middle attacks.  MarkMonitor is a  company that can own most people's ""Internet"" in minutes. It now  controls all three top free e-mail providers directly, and I  suppose it's safe to say, most currently active social media sites  too.  See for yourself. Whois yahoo.com, whois google.com, whois  gmail.com, whois facebook.com, whois fbcdn.com, whois hotmail.com,  whois msn.com... the list seems endless.How'd all this happen?This company has acquired complete access to monitor, eavesdrop, censor and fake any user of these popular Internet services in about one year (2011). In almost complete silence. For several of the sites, it also provides ""firewall proxy"" services, which means it is actually paid to intercept all communications. In and out.  The situation reminds me of Joseph Lieberman's 2010 initiative to create an ""Internet kill switch"" for the U.S.  The government only needs to control this one company, and most social media, most free e-mail, most search engines will be under its control. Not to mention most operating systems, for both computers and mobile devices.  Not only inside U.S., but globally. One company to rule them all.  I, for one, would like to ask; WTF is going on? How did these guys, this relatively small domain-hogging and pirate-chasing company, get the resources to simply acquire the DNS records of all the most popular Internet services? How can this be so totally ignored by the media, and even privacy advocates? Even conspiracy theorists seem to be completely ignoring the situation. Secure communication is an illusionOnly one company to rule them all? As if all this doesn't sound bad enough, the problem is far more widespread. MarkMonitor could easily act as a global ""kill switch"" for the sites under its rule. But as it turns out, most anyone with some resources could just as easily impersonate MarkMonitor itself.  Because, as one might have noticed in the past few months, the whole SSL certificate scheme is broken. Not in a technical sense - there's no known inherent weakness in the algorithms. But the whole SSL protection is based on trust, and that trust has failed us.  According to several sources, SSL CA certs are routinely given out to anyone willing to pay for them. As The Register points out in its analysis on TrustWave spying scandal:""Those defending Trustwave suggested that other vendors probably usedthe same approach for so-called ""data loss prevention"" environments -systems that inspect information flowing through a network to preventleaks of commercially sensitive data.""...""In fact Geotrust was openly advertising a 'Georoot' product on theirwebsite until fairly recently.""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/14/trustwave_analysis/ Oh, so the ability to impersonate anyone is normal day-to-day  practise for big business? Just imagine what government agencies  must be doing - for example in Sweden, where the military  intelligence organisation FRA has the mandate to monitor all  traffic across borders.  Who can seriously claim they trust all  the hundreds of different CA companies, several of which have been  caught red-handed with selling out their customers' security, or  covering up very serious breeches (up to and including their root  certificates being stolen).   http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/04/06/eff-uncovers-further-evid ence-of-ssl-ca-bad-behavior/ MarkMonitor is a ""brand-protecting"" company. Traditionally its  business has been reserving domains to protect brands. You buy its  service, it makes sure that nobody else can have  ""mybrandsucks.com"".  Also, they're an anti-piracy outfit.

Receiving instead of transmitting:https://threatstream.github.io/mhn/,2 years and 22 weeks ago,Korruptor1718,"I recently read an article about someone changing some files in /boot of an Ubuntu install in order to gain a user's encryption passphrase. The computer had full disk encryption and required a passphrase to unlock the encryption keys in order for the OS to boot. Basically, the attacker printed the cleartext passphrase to a file and then transmitted the file to the attacker's computer. The attacker needed physical access to the computer, and it only took about 10 minutes with the computer in order to prepare it. After that, the attacker just had to wait for the user to boot up their computer and enter their passphrase.I know a way to help counter such an attack, but I'm interested in a way to determine if/when this type of attack has occurred. My thought is to boot from a USB stick and then check to see if /boot has been modified. I think simply checking the hash of this directory against a known good /boot directory would be enough, but I'm not sure how practical this is.

Listening to a computer itself, though, as it hums away doing its calculations, is a new idea. But it is one whose time has come, according to Adi Shamir, of the Weizmann Institute, in Israel, and his colleagues. And Dr Shamir should know. He donated the initial letter of his surname to the acronym ‰ÛÏRSA‰Û, one of the most commonly used forms of encryption. Acoustic cryptanalysis, as the new method is known, threatens RSA‰Ûªs security.Acoustic cryptanalysis works by listening to a computer‰Ûªs sonic signature‰ÛÓthe noise its capacitors and coils make as they vibrate in response to the amount of power being drawn by its processor. Dr Shamir and his collaborator Eran Tromer, of Tel Aviv University, showed in 2004 that processing different RSA keys (the huge numbers needed to unlock the hidden message) produces different sonic signatures. At the time, they were unable to extract from these signatures the individual binary digits (bits) of a key, but in collaboration with Daniel Genkin of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology they have overcome this obstacle, by tricking machines into decrypting known pieces of text.Applying their method to GnuPG, a popular version of RSA, they thus extracted full 4,096-bit keys from a range of laptops in less than an hour. This would let anyone with malign intent read encrypted messages sent to those computers.Tricking the machines proved surprisingly easy. Encrypted incoming e-mails are often decrypted as they arrive, so all the three researchers had to do was send the laptops encrypted e-mails carefully crafted so the acoustic leakage produced by decrypting them was specifically related to the value of particular bits in the key. A series of such texts, each building on knowledge gleaned from the previous attack, gradually builds up the whole number.The victim of such an attack will probably not realise something is wrong until he looks at the decrypted text and realises it is gobbledygook. And, given the volume of e-mails many people receive, there is a good chance that, if the attacking e-mails are made to look like spam, or are backdated so that they drop to the bottom of the recipient‰Ûªs in-box, the attack may go unnoticed altogether.All this is no good, of course, if the sender of the attacking e-mails cannot then listen to the computer‰Ûªs hum. That can be done in several ways: with a good old-fashioned bugging microphone, for example; or with a parabolic mike some distance away; or by hijacking the target computer‰Ûªs own microphone, perhaps on the pretext of a chat on Skype or a similar service.http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21594240-ciphers-can-now-be-broken-listening-computers-use-them-unsafe-andSee also:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_%28codename%29",2 years and 24 weeks ago,VALIS1774,"(missing text from first link)If the attacker can get close to the computer himself, though (perhaps by organising a business meeting with the subject of the attack), an even cleverer approach is possible. A suitably programmed smartphone, placed close enough to the target, can both send the e-mails and do the analysis‰ÛÓa method tested, in a laboratory at least, by the researchers themselves.GnuPG has now created a patch designed to protect against this particular type of attack, using a technique called ‰ÛÏblinding‰Û, which muddies the acoustic signature. But that merely starts an arms race between the blinders and the spies. And, as if all this were not enough, Dr Shamir, Dr Tromer and Mr Genkin have now shown that if a spy can somehow touch the target computer when it is decrypting an e-mail then he (or, rather, the electronic box of tricks he is wearing) can extract the key by measuring changes in the electric potential of the computer‰Ûªs chassis relative to the ground potential of the room.This will not be the first time a spy has gone to earth, for sure. But perhaps it is the first when he is able to keep spying as he does so.Well... Fuck...

Having their info and evidence of their acts ready to be published upon your absence, from somewhere they cannot disable would do the trick. Since you'd have true data, you could even add more to it, things they haven't done. Then you could proceed to making them feel you can reach them any(where/time).

Call the cops on them (anonymously, from a burner phone) for some false hacking crime they haven't done. If they don't figure out where that came from, they'll think they have more enemies.
