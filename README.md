# cs105-dark-web-project

A CS105 project centered around a comparitive analysis of speech on the dark web to speech on the clear web.
This repository currently contains a number of scrapers and analysis scripts, each of which deals with a particular sphere of dark web
activity and its clear web counterparts. At present, the spheres represented include marketplaces, hacker forums, and microblogging
sites. A detailed description of our findings will be available here soon.
